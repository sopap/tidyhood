## Executive Summary

### Overall Score: 5.8/10 (Needs Improvement)

Tidyhood's booking flows are **functional but significantly underperforming** compared to industry best practices. While the core functionality works, critical usability issues and missing features are likely impacting conversion rates.

**Key Finding:** Your team has already built substantial improvements (documented in BOOKING_FLOW_IMPROVEMENTS_IMPLEMENTATION.md) that are **NOT YET DEPLOYED**. Deploying these improvements would immediately raise the score to ~8.5/10.

### Critical Issues Found ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. **API Error (401)** - Cancellation policy endpoint fails
2. **Google Maps Deprecation** - Using API that breaks March 2025
3. **No Price Preview** - Users can't see estimates before completing form
4. **Missing Progress Indicators** - Users don't know how many steps remain

### Immediate Impact
- **Estimated Conversion Loss:** 15-25% of potential bookings
- **Mobile User Friction:** High (missing optimizations)
- **Accessibility:** Below WCAG 2.1 AA standards
