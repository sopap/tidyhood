# Capacity Management UX Audit & Redesign Plan

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Auditor:** Principal Designer Review  
**Status:** Critical UX Issues Identified

## Executive Summary

**Assessment: NO, the current workflows are NOT intuitive for either admins or customers.**

The capacity management system suffers from fundamental UX problems that create confusion, inefficiency, and potential errors. Both admin and customer-facing interfaces need significant redesign.

---

## 🔴 Critical UX Issues

### 1. Customer-Facing Issues (Severity: HIGH)

#### Issue: Confusing Capacity Display
- **What's Wrong:** The number "30" appears on every time slot with zero context
- **User Impact:** Customers don't understand what this means (30 slots? 30 minutes? 30 orders?)
- **Cognitive Load:** High - forces users to guess meaning
- **Heuristic Violated:** Recognition rather than recall, Visibility of system status

**Current Design:**
```
☐ 8:00 AM - 10:00 AM     30
☐ 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM    30
☐ 12:00 PM - 2:00 PM     30
```

**Intuitive Design:**
```
☐ 8:00 AM - 10:00 AM
☐ 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM
☐ 12:00 PM - 2:00 PM

(Only show available slots)
```

#### Issue: Information Overload
- **What's Wrong:** Showing capacity numbers to customers who don't care
- **User Impact:** Adds noise, doesn't help decision-making
- **Best Practice:** Airlines, OpenTable, etc. only show available times
- **Heuristic Violated:** Aesthetic and minimalist design

### 2. Admin-Facing Issues (Severity: HIGH)

#### Issue: Unclear Relationship Between Configuration Layers
- **What's Wrong:** Three capacity values with unclear relationships:
  1. Partner default: `max_orders_per_slot = 1`
  2. Slot capacity: Shows "0 / 10 orders"
  3. Display: Shows "30"
- **Admin Impact:** Can't understand which value is actually used
- **Error Potential:** High - admins might set wrong capacity
- **Heuristic Violated:** Consistency and standards, Match between system and real world

**Mental Model Confusion:**
```
Admin thinks: "I set partner to 1 order per slot"
System shows: "0 / 10 orders available"
Customer sees: "30"

Which one is true? 🤷‍♂️
```

#### Issue: Tedious Slot Creation Workflow
- **What's Wrong:** Must manually create each individual slot
- **Admin Impact:** Creating a week's worth of slots takes 30+ minutes
- **Efficiency:** Very poor - repetitive task with no bulk operations
- **Heuristic Violated:** Efficiency of use, Flexibility and efficiency of use

**Current Workflow:**
```
1. Click "Add Capacity"
2. Select partner
3. Select date
4. Select start time
5. Select end time
6. Enter capacity (confusing which value to use)
7. Click save
8. Repeat 20 more times for one week 😫
```

**Intuitive Workflow:**
```
1. Click "Quick Setup"
2. Select partners (multi-select)
3. Select date range (e.g., "Next 7 days")
4. Select time pattern (e.g., "9am-5pm, 2-hour slots")
5. Confirm capacity (default to partner settings)
6. Click "Create All" → Done in 30 seconds ✅
```

#### Issue: Poor Scannability
- **What's Wrong:** Capacity table is flat, hard to scan
- **Admin Impact:** Can't quickly see what days/times are booked
- **Missing:** Visual hierarchy, grouping, color coding
- **Heuristic Violated:** Recognition rather than recall, Help users recognize problems

### 3. Data Consistency Issues (Severity: CRITICAL)

#### Issue: Three Sources of Truth
```
Partner Settings:    max_orders_per_slot = 1
Slot Configuration: max_units = 10
Display:            Shows "30"
```

**Why This is Critical:**
- Admins can't trust what they see
- Creates data integrity issues
- Makes debugging impossible
- Violates single source of truth principle

## 📊 Workflow Analysis

### Current Admin Workflow: Setting Up a Week

```
Goal: Set up 3 partners for 7 days, 4 time slots per day

Current Process:
1. Navigate to Capacity page
2. Click "Add Capacity" 
3. Fill form for slot 1 (Partner A, Monday 8am)
4. Click save
5. Wait for page reload
6. Repeat steps 2-5... 83 MORE TIMES
   (3 partners × 7 days × 4 slots = 84 total operations)

Time Required: 30-45 minutes
Error Rate: High (copy-paste errors, wrong dates, etc.)
User Satisfaction: Very Low 😤
```

### Proposed Admin Workflow: Setting Up a Week

```
Goal: Set up 3 partners for 7 days, 4 time slots per day

New Process:
1. Navigate to Capacity page
2. Click "Quick Setup"
3. Select partners: ☑ All 3 partners
4. Date range: Oct 21-27, 2025
5. Time pattern: 8am-4pm, 2-hour slots
6. Capacity: 1 order per slot (pre-filled from partner defaults)
7. Preview: "Will create 84 slots"
8. Click "Create All Slots"
9. Done! ✅

Time Required: 30 seconds
Error Rate: Very Low (batch operation, validated upfront)
User Satisfaction: High 😊
```

## 💡 Recommended Redesign

### Phase 1: Customer-Facing (IMMEDIATE - High Impact)

#### Before:
```
Available Time Slots          ❌ CONFUSING
☐ 8:00 AM - 10:00 AM    30
☐ 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM   30
☐ 12:00 PM - 2:00 PM    30
☐ 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM     30
☐ 4:00 PM - 6:00 PM     30
```

#### After:
```
Available Time Slots          ✅ CLEAR
☐ 8:00 AM - 10:00 AM
☐ 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM
☐ 12:00 PM - 2:00 PM

(Full slots are hidden entirely)
```

**Implementation:**
- Remove ALL capacity indicators from customer view
- Filter out fully booked slots (available_units === 0)
- Only show clickable, available time slots

### Phase 2: Admin-Facing (IMMEDIATE - High Impact)

#### Before:
```
Capacity Slots (72)                              ❌ CONFUSING

PARTNER          TYPE    DATE & TIME        CAPACITY    STATUS    ACTIONS
Lenox W&F        LAUNDRY Oct 20, 6:00 AM   0/10 orders available Delete
                         6:00 AM - 8:00 AM              30

Harlem Fresh     LAUNDRY Oct 20, 6:00 AM   0/10 orders available Delete
                         6:00 AM - 8:00 AM              30
```

#### After:
```
Capacity Management                              ✅ CLEAR
