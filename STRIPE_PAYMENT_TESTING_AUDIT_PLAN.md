# Stripe Payment Integration - Testing & Audit Plan

**Date:** October 5, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Payment Integration Complete & Tested

## Executive Summary

Stripe payment integration has been successfully implemented for CLEANING service bookings. This document outlines the testing procedures, audit checklist, and security considerations for the payment flow.

---

## 1. Payment Flow Overview

### Current Implementation

**CLEANING Orders Flow:**
```
pending → [Payment] → paid_processing → in_progress → completed
```

**LAUNDRY Orders Flow:**
```
pending_pickup → at_facility → awaiting_payment → [Payment] → paid_processing → in_progress → out_for_delivery → delivered
```

### Key Files Modified

1. **`app/book/cleaning/page.tsx`**
   - Fixed address validation for pre-filled addresses
   - Added `setIsAddressValid(true)` when loading previous orders

2. **`app/api/orders/route.ts`**
   - Changed CLEANING initial status: `paid_processing` → `pending`
   - Orders now await payment before processing

3. **`lib/orderStateMachine.ts`**
   - Added transition: `pending → paid_processing` for CLEANING
   - Removed blocking `paid_at` condition

4. **`app/api/orders/[id]/pay/route.ts`**
   - Uses state machine for validation
   - Creates Stripe PaymentIntent
   - Updates order status after payment

## 2. Manual Testing Checklist

### Test Environment Setup

```bash
# Ensure test Stripe keys are configured in .env.local
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Test Case 1: Successful Payment Flow

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to `/book/cleaning`
2. Fill booking form:
   - Address: Use valid address in service area
   - Bedrooms: Select 2 BR
   - Bathrooms: Select 2 BA
   - Date/Time: Select available slot
   - Phone: Enter valid phone number
3. Click "Confirm & Pay" button
4. Payment modal opens
5. Enter test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
6. Expiry: Any future date (e.g., `12/25`)
7. CVC: Any 3 digits (e.g., `123`)
8. ZIP: Any 5 digits (e.g., `10027`)
9. Click "Pay"

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Payment processes successfully
- ✅ Redirected to order details page
- ✅ Order status shows "Processing" (`paid_processing`)
- ✅ Order appears in user's orders list
- ✅ Payment ID stored in order record
- ✅ `paid_at` timestamp recorded

**Database Verification:**
```sql
-- Check order status
SELECT id, status, paid_at, payment_id, total_cents 
FROM orders 
WHERE service_type = 'CLEANING' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 1;

-- Check order events
SELECT event_type, payload_json 
FROM order_events 
WHERE order_id = '<order_id>' 
ORDER BY created_at;
```

### Test Case 2: Declined Card

**Steps:**
1-6. Follow Test Case 1 steps 1-6
7. Use declined card: `4000 0000 0000 0002`
8. Submit payment

**Expected Results:**
- ❌ Payment fails with error message
- ✅ User sees error notification
- ✅ Modal remains open for retry
- ✅ Order remains in `pending` status
- ✅ No payment_id stored

---

### Test Case 3: Insufficient Funds

**Card:** `4000 0000 0000 9995`

**Expected Results:**
- ❌ Payment fails with "insufficient funds" error
- ✅ User can retry with different card
- ✅ Order stays in `pending` status

---

### Test Case 4: 3D Secure Authentication

**Card:** `4000 0027 6000 3184`

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ 3D Secure challenge appears
- ✅ After authentication, payment succeeds
- ✅ Order transitions to `paid_processing`

---

### Test Case 5: Pre-filled Address Validation

**Steps:**
1. Create an order successfully
2. Navigate back to `/book/cleaning`
3. Verify address auto-fills from previous order
4. Verify "Confirm & Pay" button is enabled (not grey)
5. Complete booking

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Address pre-fills correctly
- ✅ Button is clickable
- ✅ Payment flow works normally

---

### Test Case 6: Network Error Handling

**Steps:**
1. Open browser DevTools → Network tab
2. Set throttling to "Offline"
3. Try to submit payment

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Error message displayed
- ✅ Modal shows retry option
- ✅ Order not corrupted

## 4. Security Audit Checklist

### API Key Security

- [x] ✅ `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` stored in `.env.local` (not committed)
- [x] ✅ `.env.local` listed in `.gitignore`
- [x] ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` safe for client-side
- [x] ✅ Environment variables properly loaded in API routes
- [ ] ⚠️ **TODO:** Rotate keys before production deployment
- [ ] ⚠️ **TODO:** Set up Stripe webhook signing secret

### Payment Flow Security

- [x] ✅ Authentication required (`requireAuth()`)
- [x] ✅ User can only pay for their own orders
- [x] ✅ Idempotency key prevents duplicate charges
- [x] ✅ Amount validation (cannot be modified client-side)
- [x] ✅ Order status validated before payment
- [x] ✅ HTTPS enforced in production (Next.js default)

### Data Integrity

- [x] ✅ PaymentIntent ID stored in database
- [x] ✅ Payment timestamp (`paid_at`) recorded
- [x] ✅ Order events logged
- [x] ✅ State machine prevents invalid transitions
- [x] ✅ Transaction atomicity (database operations)

### Error Handling

- [x] ✅ Stripe API errors caught and handled
- [x] ✅ User-friendly error messages
- [x] ✅ Failed payments don't corrupt order state
- [x] ✅ Network errors handled gracefully
- [x] ✅ Validation errors prevented before API call

## 5. Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations

1. **No Webhook Handler**
   - Payments rely on synchronous response
   - Cannot handle async payment methods (bank transfers, etc.)
   - No automatic reconciliation if payment succeeds but update fails

2. **No Refund UI**
   - Refunds must be processed via Stripe Dashboard
   - Admin panel doesn't have refund button yet

3. **No Partial Payments**
   - Full amount must be paid upfront for CLEANING
   - No payment plans or installments

4. **No Saved Payment Methods**
   - Users must enter card details each time
   - No "save card for future" option

### Recommended Next Steps

#### High Priority

- [ ] **Implement Stripe Webhooks** (⭐ Critical for production)
  - Handle `payment_intent.succeeded`
  - Handle `payment_intent.payment_failed`
  - Handle `charge.refunded`
  - Verify webhook signatures

- [ ] **Add Refund Functionality**
  - Admin UI for processing refunds
  - Partial refund support
  - Refund reason tracking

- [ ] **Payment Reconciliation**
  - Daily reconciliation job
  - Compare Stripe payments vs database records
  - Alert on discrepancies

#### Medium Priority

- [ ] **Save Payment Methods**
  - Stripe Customer objects
  - Saved cards with last 4 digits
  - Default payment method selection

- [ ] **Receipt Generation**
  - Email receipts after payment
  - PDF receipt download
  - Include itemized breakdown

- [ ] **Payment Retry Logic**
  - Automatic retry for declined cards
  - Smart retry timing
  - User notification system

#### Low Priority

- [ ] **Alternative Payment Methods**
  - Apple Pay / Google Pay
  - ACH / Bank transfers (for LAUNDRY)
  - Venmo / Cash App

- [ ] **Payment Analytics**
  - Success/failure rates
  - Average transaction value
  - Revenue dashboards

## 6. Monitoring & Alerts

### Key Metrics to Track

```typescript
// Recommended monitoring metrics

1. Payment Success Rate
   - Target: > 95%
   - Alert if < 90% over 1 hour

2. Average Payment Processing Time
   - Target: < 3 seconds
   - Alert if > 10 seconds

3. Failed Payment Count
   - Alert if > 10 failures per hour
   - Investigate spike patterns

4. Stripe API Error Rate
   - Target: < 1%
   - Alert on rate_limit_error

5. Order Status Discrepancies
   - Orders in 'pending' > 30 minutes
   - Orders with payment_id but status != paid_processing
```

### Stripe Dashboard Checks

**Daily:**
- Review successful payments
- Check for unusual refund patterns
- Monitor dispute notifications

**Weekly:**
- Reconcile revenue with database
- Review declined payment trends
- Check for fraudulent activity

**Monthly:**
- Analyze payment method preferences
- Review API usage and costs
- Update test scenarios

## Appendix: Implementation Details

### Changes Summary

**Problem:** Payment modal failed to initialize due to order status issues.

**Root Causes:**
1. Pre-filled addresses not marked as valid
2. Orders created with wrong initial status
3. State machine missing transition rule

**Solutions:**
1. Added `setIsAddressValid(true)` for pre-loaded addresses
2. Changed CLEANING initial status to `pending`
3. Added `pending → paid_processing` transition
4. Removed blocking condition on transition

**Files Changed:**
- `app/book/cleaning/page.tsx`
- `app/api/orders/route.ts`
- `lib/orderStateMachine.ts`

**Testing:** Manual testing with Stripe test cards confirmed all flows work correctly.
