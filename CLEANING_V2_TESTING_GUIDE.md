3. Hard refresh browser (`Ctrl+Shift+R` / Cmd+Shift+R`)

### Issue: "Partner Card not showing"

```

## üíæ Test Data Setup (Optional)

### Creating Test Orders

If you need test orders with specific data:

  order_details, 
  '{square_feet}', 
  '1200'
)
WHERE id = 'your-order-id';

-- Update order to have deep clean
UPDATE orders 
SET order_details = jsonb_set(
  order_details, 
  '{deep}', 
  'true'
)
WHERE id = 'your-order-id';

-- Update order to have addons
UPDATE orders 
SET order_details = jsonb_set(
  order_details, 
  '{addons}', 
  '["Inside fridge", "Inside oven", "Laundry"]'::jsonb
)
WHERE id = 'your-order-id';

-- Assign partner to order
UPDATE orders 
SET partner_id = 'your-partner-id'
