# Booking Flow Phase 2: Deployment Execution Guide
**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Strategy:** Option B - Direct Replacement  
**Status:** READY TO EXECUTE

---

## Pre-Deployment Checklist ✅

- [x] Phase 1 verification complete (94/100 readiness score)
- [x] All 22 improvement files verified present
- [x] Backup created: `app/book/laundry/page-backup-20251025-171818.tsx`
- [x] Deployment script created: `scripts/deploy-booking-improvements.sh`
- [ ] Database 401 error fix (can be done post-deployment)
- [ ] Team notified of deployment
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards prepared

---

## Deployment Steps

### Automated Deployment (Recommended)

**Run the deployment script:**
```bash
chmod +x scripts/deploy-booking-improvements.sh
./scripts/deploy-booking-improvements.sh
```

The script will:
1. Create git tag `booking-flow-v1-backup` for rollback
2. Verify backup file exists
3. Copy `page-fixed.tsx` → `page.tsx`
4. Commit changes with detailed message
5. Push to production
6. Display monitoring instructions

### Manual Deployment (Alternative)

If you prefer manual execution:

```bash
# Step 1: Create rollback tag
git tag -a booking-flow-v1-backup -m "Backup before booking flow improvements"
git push origin booking-flow-v1-backup

# Step 2: Replace file
cp app/book/laundry/page-fixed.tsx app/book/laundry/page.tsx

# Step 3: Commit
git add app/book/laundry/page.tsx
git commit -m "Deploy improved booking flow (Direct Replacement)"

# Step 4: Push to production
git push origin main

# Step 5: Monitor Vercel deployment
# Watch: https://vercel.com/[your-project]/deployments
```

---

## Post-Deployment Monitoring (CRITICAL)

### First Hour Checklist

**Immediately after deployment:**
- [ ] Check Vercel logs for errors
- [ ] Test booking flow manually (desktop + mobile)
- [ ] Verify no console errors in browser
- [ ] Complete one test booking end-to-end
- [ ] Check order appears in database correctly
- [ ] Verify SMS notification sent
- [ ] Test payment processing works

**Alert Thresholds:**
```
⚠️ Error rate > 1% → Investigate immediately
🔴 Error rate > 2% → Rollback
⚠️ Booking completion drops >10% → Investigate
🔴 Booking completion drops >20% → Rollback
⚠️ Page load time > 3s → Investigate
🔴 Any payment processing failures → Rollback
```

### First 24 Hours Monitoring

**Check every 2-4 hours:**
- Vercel error logs
- Stripe dashboard (payment success rate)
- Twilio logs (SMS delivery rate)
- Support ticket volume
- User feedback/complaints
- Analytics conversion funnel

**Key URLs to Monitor:**
- Booking page: https://tidyhood.nyc/book/laundry
- API endpoints: `/api/estimate`, `/api/slots`, `/api/orders`
- Order creation flow
- Payment processing

---

## Rollback Procedures

### If Issues Arise (3 Options)

**Option 1: Vercel Dashboard Rollback (FASTEST - 30 seconds)**
1. Go to Vercel dashboard → Deployments
2. Find previous deployment (before booking flow changes)
3. Click "Promote to Production"
4. Confirm
5. Wait ~30 seconds for rollback to complete

**Option 2: Git Revert (2-3 minutes)**
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
# Vercel auto-deploys in 2-3 minutes
```

**Option 3: Manual Restore (2-3 minutes)**
```bash
cp app/book/laundry/page-backup-20251025-171818.tsx app/book/laundry/page.tsx
git add app/book/laundry/page.tsx
git commit -m "Rollback booking flow improvements"
git push origin main
```

### Rollback Decision Matrix

**Immediate Rollback (P0):**
- Site completely down
- All bookings failing
- All payments failing
- Database errors on every request

**Urgent Rollback (P1 - within 1 hour):**
- Error rate >2%
- Booking completion rate drops >20%
- Mobile completely broken
- Payment success rate <95%

**Scheduled Rollback (P2 - within 4 hours):**
- Minor feature not working
- Error rate 1-2%
- Booking completion down 10-20%
- User complaints increasing

**No Rollback (Monitor):**
- Error rate <1%
- Booking completion stable or improved
- Minor UI issues only
- Fix forward instead of rolling back

---

## Success Criteria

### Must Achieve (Week 1):

✅ **Booking completion rate:** Stable OR increased ≥10%  
✅ **Error rate:** Remains ≤1% (current baseline: <0.5%)  
✅ **Payment processing:** 100% success rate  
✅ **SMS notifications:** 100% delivery rate  
✅ **Support tickets:** No increase related to booking  
✅ **Mobile experience:** No regression, ideally improved  
✅ **Page load time:** Remains <3 seconds  

**If any criterion fails:** Investigate immediately, rollback if critical

## Metrics Dashboard Setup

### Analytics Events to Track

```javascript
// If using Google Analytics, Mixpanel, etc.

// Page view
analytics.track('Booking Page Viewed', {
  service: 'laundry',
  device: 'mobile' | 'desktop',
  source: referrer
});

// User interactions
analytics.track('Address Entered', { zip: '10027' });
analytics.track('Weight Tier Selected', { tier: 'medium' });
analytics.track('Price Estimated', { amount: 54.99 });
analytics.track('Slot Selected', { date: '2025-10-26', time: '14:00' });

// Conversion
analytics.track('Booking Submitted', { 
  revenue: 54.99,
  service: 'laundry',
  rush: false 
});

analytics.track('Booking Completed', {
  order_id: 'xxx',
  revenue: 54.99,
  time_spent_seconds: 180
});

// Errors
analytics.track('Booking Error', {
  error_type: 'api_failure',
  step: 'address_entry'
});
```

### Funnel Analysis
```
Step 1: Page View → Address Entry (engagement rate)
Step 2: Address → Service Selection (drop-off)
Step 3: Service → Slot Selection (progression)
Step 4: Slot → Contact Info (near-completion)
Step 5: Contact → Submit (final conversion)
Step 6: Submit → Success (technical success)
```
