## ‚úÖ Phase 3.2: Partner Quote Variance System

**Status**: Complete
**File**: `components/partner/QuoteForm.tsx`

**New Features**:
1. **Variance Calculation**:
   - Real-time comparison between customer estimate and partner quote
   - Percentage variance displayed prominently
   - Threshold: 20% triggers warning

2. **Visual Warnings**:
   - Yellow banner for variances >20%
   - Clear messaging: "Large Price Variance Detected"
   - Shows both amounts and percentage difference

3. **Price Comparison Section**:
   - Customer's estimated amount
   - Partner's quoted amount
   - Variance percentage (color-coded)
   - Helps partners understand customer expectations

4. **Partner Guidance**:
   - Warning text: "Variances over 20% may require additional customer approval"
   - Encourages double-checking measurements
   - Reduces customer disputes

**Technical Implementation**:
- Added `estimatedAmountCents` prop to QuoteForm
- Variance calculated: `((quote - estimate) / estimate) * 100`
- No changes needed to API route (already compatible)
- No authorization checks (Setup Intent model)

**Benefits**:
- Catches measurement errors before submission
- Reduces customer friction and chargebacks
- Improves partner-customer communication
- Supports variance-based approval (instead of hard limits)

## ‚úÖ Phase 3.3: Cancellation Flow Review

**Status**: Verified Compatible - No Changes Needed
**Files Reviewed**:
- `app/api/orders/[id]/cancel/route.ts`
- `components/order/CancelModal.tsx`

**Key Findings**:

### API Route Analysis:
‚úÖ **Already uses Stripe refunds** (not PaymentIntent cancellation)
- Cleaning orders: Uses `refund` API via `cancelCleaning()`
- Laundry orders: No payment yet, so no Stripe call needed
- No authorization release logic found
- Payment methods stay saved automatically

‚úÖ **Proper messaging**:
- Shows refund amounts, not "releasing hold"
- Calculates cancellation fees correctly
- Handles capacity release properly
- Creates proper audit trails

### UI Modal Analysis:
‚úÖ **User-friendly cancellation flow**:
- Two-step process: reason selection ‚Üí confirmation
- Shows refund breakdown clearly
- Displays cancellation fees transparently
- No mentions of "holds" or "authorizations"

‚úÖ **Correct refund messaging**:
- "You'll receive a refund of $XX.XX within 5-10 business days"
- "A $XX.XX cancellation fee will be deducted" (when applicable)
- "Your order will be canceled at no charge" (for laundry)

**Conclusion**: The cancellation system was already built correctly for Setup Intent from the beginning. No modifications required.

## üîÑ Integration Points Summary

### Frontend ‚Üí Backend:
1. **Booking Pages** ‚Üí **`/api/payment/setup`**
   - Passes estimated amount, service details, payment method
   - Saga creates order + saves payment method
   - Returns order ID for redirect

2. **Partner Quote Form** ‚Üí **`/api/partner/orders/[id]/quote`**
   - Shows variance warnings before submission
   - No authorization checks needed
   - Variance is informational, not blocking

3. **Cancellation Modal** ‚Üí **`/api/orders/[id]/cancel`**
   - Already uses refund API
   - No authorization release
   - Payment method stays saved

### Setup Intent Flow:
```
Customer Books Service

## üéì Key Learnings

### What Went Well:
1. **Reusable Components**: StripePaymentCollector worked perfectly for both services
2. **Pattern Reuse**: Cleaning page template made laundry page fast to implement
3. **Clean Architecture**: Payment saga isolated complexity beautifully
4. **Existing Systems**: Cancellation already used refunds (no changes needed!)

### Challenges Overcome:
1. **3DS Complexity**: Redirect flow required careful state management
2. **Dual-Flow Support**: Feature flag integration for gradual rollout
3. **Variance Warnings**: Real-time calculation in React state
4. **Type Safety**: TypeScript interfaces for order details

### Best Practices Followed:
1. **Idempotency**: All payment operations use idempotency keys
2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch with proper error types
3. **User Feedback**: Toast notifications for all user actions
4. **Audit Trails**: All operations logged to order_events table
