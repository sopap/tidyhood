# Cleaning Service V2 - Implementation Summary

**Status**: Week 1 Complete - Database & API Infrastructure ‚úÖ  
**Feature Flag**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_FLAG_CLEANING_V2=1` (currently OFF)  
**Timeline**: 3-week implementation, 1-week gradual rollout

---

## üéØ Overview

Refactoring the cleaning service order flow to support granular status tracking, disputes, partner location tracking, and no-shows. Uses a **unified status system** that extends the existing `order_status` enum rather than creating parallel systems.

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Single enum approach**: Extended existing `order_status` enum with cleaning-specific statuses
2. **Service-aware RPC**: One `transition_order_status()` function handles both LAUNDRY and CLEANING
3. **Backward compatible**: Zero impact on existing laundry orders
4. **Feature flagged**: Safe rollout behind `CLEANING_V2` flag

---

## ‚úÖ Completed (Week 1)

### Database Layer

**File**: `supabase/migrations/020_cleaning_status_system.sql`

- Extended `order_status` enum with 7 new statuses:
  - `assigned`, `en_route`, `on_site` (location tracking)
  - `disputed`, `refunded` (dispute resolution)
  - `cleaner_no_show`, `customer_no_show` (no-show tracking)

- Added columns to `orders` table:
  ```sql
  assigned_at, en_route_at, on_site_at       -- Location timestamps
  started_at, completed_at                    -- Work timestamps
  disputed_at, dispute_reason, resolved_at    -- Dispute management
  resolution_type, proof, no_show_type        -- Additional metadata
  ```

- Created `order_events` audit table:
  - Tracks every status transition
  - Records actor_id, actor_role, old/new status, metadata
  - RLS policies for customer/partner visibility

- Created unified RPC function:
  ```sql
  transition_order_status(
    p_order_id uuid,
    p_action text,
    p_actor_id uuid,
    p_actor_role text,
    p_meta jsonb
  )
  ```
  - Service-aware validation (CLEANING vs LAUNDRY)
  - Role-based authorization (customer/partner/admin)
  - Automatic audit trail creation
  - Returns success/error as JSONB

- Helper function:
  ```sql
  get_valid_actions(p_order_id uuid, p_actor_role text) RETURNS text[]
  ```

**Rollback**: `supabase/migrations/020_cleaning_status_system_rollback.sql`

### Type System

**File**: `types/cleaningOrders.ts`

- Discriminated union types:
  ```typescript
  CleaningOrder | LaundryOrder (based on service_type)
  ```

- Status enums:
  ```typescript
  CleaningStatus: 11 statuses
  LaundryStatus: 10 statuses (existing)
  ```

- Action types:
  ```typescript
  CleaningAction: assign, en_route, arrive, start, complete, etc.
  LaundryAction: existing actions preserved
  ```

- UI configuration:
  ```typescript
  CLEANING_STAGES: 3 primary stages with sub-states
  CLEANING_STATUS_CONFIG: labels, colors, icons, descriptions
  ```

- Helper functions:
  - `isCleaningOrder()`, `isLaundryOrder()` - Type guards
  - `canOpenDispute()` - Business logic
  - `isTerminalStatus()`, `isActiveStatus()` - Status checks

### API Layer

**File**: `app/api/orders/[id]/transition/route.ts`

- **POST /api/orders/[id]/transition**
  - Validates session with `requireAuth()`
  - Determines actor role (customer/partner/admin)
  - Calls `transition_order_status()` RPC
  - Triggers side effects (notifications, analytics)
  - Returns updated order state

- **GET /api/orders/[id]/transition**
  - Returns available actions for current user/status
  - Calls `get_valid_actions()` RPC
  - Used by UI to show/hide action buttons

- Side effects framework (stub):
  - Partner assignment notifications
  - Customer en route notifications
  - Rating requests on completion
  - Admin alerts for disputes
  - Analytics event logging

### Feature Flag

**File**: `lib/features.ts`

```typescript
CLEANING_V2: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FLAG_CLEANING_V2 === '1'
```

Currently set to OFF for safe development.

## üîç Testing Guide

### Manual Testing (Staging)

**Customer Flow**:
1. Book cleaning order (triggers pending status)
2. Wait for admin to assign partner
3. Receive notification when partner en route
4. Partner arrives and starts work
5. Receive notification when completed
6. Open dispute if needed

**Partner Flow**:
1. Receive assignment notification
2. Mark en route when leaving
3. Mark arrival at location
4. Start cleaning work
5. Complete and upload proof photos
6. Handle customer no-show if needed

**Admin Flow**:
1. Assign orders to partners
2. Monitor active orders
3. Handle disputes
4. Process refunds if needed

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] All valid transitions work
- [ ] Invalid transitions are blocked with clear error messages
- [ ] Role enforcement works (customer can't mark en_route, etc.)
- [ ] Audit trail is created for every transition
- [ ] Notifications are sent at key milestones
- [ ] Dispute window enforced (7 days after completion)
- [ ] No-show marking requires confirmation
- [ ] Mobile UI is fully functional (‚â§375px width)
- [ ] Feature flag toggle works (ON = new UI, OFF = legacy)

---

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Pre-Deployment

1. Code review of all PRs
2. Run full test suite (unit + integration + e2e)
3. Performance testing (RPC function execution time)
4. Security audit (RLS policies, role checks)

### Staging Deployment

```bash
# 1. Run migration
cd supabase
npx supabase db push

# 2. Verify migration
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT enumlabel FROM pg_enum WHERE enumtypid = 'order_status'::regtype;"

# 3. Test RPC function
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT transition_order_status('test-order-id', 'assign', 'admin-user-id', 'admin', '{"partner_id": "partner-id"}'::jsonb);"

# 4. Enable feature flag
# Set NEXT_PUBLIC_FLAG_CLEANING_V2=1 in Vercel staging
```

### Production Deployment

```bash
# 1. Backup database
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# 2. Run migration (during low traffic)
npx supabase db push

# 3. Verify zero impact on laundry orders
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE service_type = 'LAUNDRY' AND status IN ('pending', 'pending_pickup');"

# 4. Deploy code (flag OFF)
git push production main

# 5. Monitor logs and metrics
# Watch for RPC errors, slow queries, etc.
```

### Rollback Plan

If issues are detected:

```bash
# 1. Disable feature flag immediately
# Set NEXT_PUBLIC_FLAG_CLEANING_V2=0 in Vercel

# 2. If database issues, run rollback migration
psql $DATABASE_URL < supabase/migrations/020_cleaning_status_system_rollback.sql

# 3. Verify system stability
# Check error rates, latency, customer complaints
```

## üêõ Known Issues / Limitations

1. **Enum values can't be removed**: If rollback is needed, enum values remain in DB but are marked deprecated
2. **No auto-assignment yet**: Admins must manually assign orders (AUTO_ASSIGN feature flag not yet implemented)
3. **Proof upload not implemented**: UI placeholder exists but S3 integration pending
4. **No SMS notifications**: Side effects are logged but not executed
5. **Analytics not integrated**: PostHog/Amplitude integration pending

---

## üéâ Next Steps

Once Week 1 is complete:

1. **Code review this implementation**
2. **Run database migration in staging**
3. **Begin Week 2 UI components**
4. **Schedule partner training session**
5. **Prepare customer communication**
