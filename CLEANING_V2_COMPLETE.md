## 📦 Deliverables

### 1. Database Infrastructure ✅

**Files**:
- `supabase/migrations/020_cleaning_status_system.sql` (450 lines)
- `supabase/migrations/020_cleaning_status_system_rollback.sql` (50 lines)

**Delivered**:
- Extended `order_status` enum with 7 new statuses:
  - `assigned` - Partner assigned to order
  - `en_route` - Partner traveling to location
  - `on_site` - Partner arrived at location
  - `disputed` - Customer opened dispute
  - `refunded` - Dispute resolved with refund
  - `cleaner_no_show` - Partner failed to arrive
  - `customer_no_show` - Customer not available

- Added 10 tracking columns to `orders` table:
  ```sql
  assigned_at timestamptz
  en_route_at timestamptz
  on_site_at timestamptz
  started_at timestamptz
  completed_at timestamptz
  disputed_at timestamptz
  dispute_reason text
  resolved_at timestamptz
  resolution_type text
  no_show_type text
  proof jsonb
  ```

- Created `order_events` audit table:
  - Tracks every status transition
  - Records actor_id, actor_role, old/new status
  - RLS policies for customer/partner visibility

- Unified RPC function `transition_order_status()`:
  - Service-aware validation (CLEANING vs LAUNDRY)
  - Role-based authorization (customer/partner/admin)
  - Automatic audit trail creation
  - Returns success/error as JSONB

- Helper RPC `get_valid_actions()`:
  - Returns available actions for current user/status
  - Used by UI to show/hide action buttons

**Test Status**: ✅ Migrations tested, idempotent, reversible

---

### 2. Type System ✅

**File**: `types/cleaningOrders.ts` (410 lines)

**Delivered**:

  CleaningOrder: Service-specific interface
  LaundryOrder: Service-specific interface
  Order: Discriminated union
  ```

- Action types:
  ```typescript
  CleaningAction: 13 actions (assign, en_route, arrive, etc.)
  LaundryAction: 8 actions (mark_pending_pickup, etc.)
  OrderAction: Union of both
  ```

- UI configuration:
  ```typescript
  CLEANING_STAGES: 3 primary stages
  CLEANING_STATUS_CONFIG: Labels, colors, icons, descriptions
  ```

- Helper functions:
  - `isCleaningOrder()`, `isLaundryOrder()` - Type guards

## 🚀 Deployment Guide

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [x] Code review completed
- [x] Migrations are idempotent
- [x] Rollback script exists
- [x] Feature flag is OFF
- [x] Zero breaking changes confirmed
- [x] Documentation complete

### Staging Deployment

```bash
# 1. Run database migration
cd supabase
npx supabase db push

# 2. Verify migration
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "
  SELECT enumlabel 
  FROM pg_enum 
  WHERE enumtypid = 'order_status'::regtype;
"

# Expected output should include:
# assigned, en_route, on_site, disputed, refunded, 
# cleaner_no_show, customer_no_show

# 3. Test RPC function
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "
  SELECT transition_order_status(
    'test-order-id'::uuid,
    'assign',
    'admin-user-id'::uuid,
    'admin',
    '{\"partner_id\": \"partner-id\"}'::jsonb
  );
"

# 4. Enable feature flag for testing
# Set NEXT_PUBLIC_FLAG_CLEANING_V2=1 in Vercel Staging
```

### Production Deployment

```bash
# 1. Backup database
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# 2. Run migration (during low traffic, e.g., 2-4 AM)
npx supabase db push

# 3. Verify zero impact on laundry orders
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "
  SELECT COUNT(*) 
  FROM orders 
  WHERE service_type = 'LAUNDRY' 
    AND status IN ('pending', 'pending_pickup');
"

# 4. Deploy code (flag OFF)
git push production main

# 5. Monitor logs and metrics for 24 hours
# Watch for:
# - RPC errors
# - Slow queries
# - Customer complaints
```

### Rollback Procedure

If issues are detected:

```bash
# 1. Disable feature flag immediately
# Set NEXT_PUBLIC_FLAG_CLEANING_V2=0 in Vercel

# 2. If database issues, run rollback migration
psql $DATABASE_URL < supabase/migrations/020_cleaning_status_system_rollback.sql

# 3. Verify system stability
# Check error rates, latency, customer feedback

# 4. Post-mortem
# Document what went wrong
# Create fix plan
# Re-test before next deployment
```

## 🔄 Integration

### For Frontend Developers

Update `app/orders/[id]/page.tsx`:

```typescript
import { CleaningOrderView } from '@/components/cleaning/CleaningOrderView';
import { isCleaningOrder } from '@/types/cleaningOrders';
import { FEATURES } from '@/lib/features';

export default async function OrderDetailPage({ params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
  const order = await fetchOrder(params.id);
  
  // Feature flag check
  if (order.service_type === 'CLEANING' && FEATURES.CLEANING_V2) {
    return <CleaningOrderView order={order as CleaningOrder} userRole="customer" />;
  }
  
  // Legacy view for laundry or if flag is OFF
  return <LegacyOrderView order={order} />;
}
```

### For Backend Developers

Status transitions via API:

```typescript
// POST /api/orders/[order_id]/transition
const response = await fetch(`/api/orders/${orderId}/transition`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    action: 'assign',  // or en_route, arrive, start, complete, etc.
    metadata: {
      partner_id: 'uuid',  // for assign action
      reason: 'text',      // for cancel/dispute actions
      proof: [...],        // for dispute action
    }
  })
});
```

### For Partner Portal

Extend existing `StatusUpdater` component:

```typescript
import { isCleaningOrder } from '@/types/cleaningOrders';

function StatusUpdater({ order }) {
  if (isCleaningOrder(order)) {
    return (
      <select onChange={handleCleaningAction}>
        <option value="en_route">Mark En Route</option>
        <option value="arrive">Mark Arrived</option>
        <option value="start">Start Cleaning</option>
        <option value="complete">Complete Cleaning</option>
        <option value="mark_customer_no_show">Customer No-Show</option>
      </select>
    );
  }
  
  // Existing laundry logic...
}
```

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Enum Values Persistence**
   - Issue: PostgreSQL enum values cannot be removed, only renamed
   - Impact: If rollback is needed, enum values remain in DB but are unused
   - Mitigation: Rollback script adds `_deprecated` suffix to new values

2. **No Auto-Assignment**
   - Issue: Orders must be manually assigned by admin
   - Impact: Admin workload increases with volume
   - Mitigation: AUTO_ASSIGN feature flag planned for Phase 2

3. **Proof Upload Stub**
   - Issue: Photo upload endpoint `/api/upload` not implemented
   - Impact: Dispute photos cannot be uploaded yet
   - Mitigation: S3 integration planned, UI ready

4. **No SMS Notifications**
   - Issue: Side effects are logged but not executed
   - Impact: Customers don't receive real-time updates
   - Mitigation: Twilio integration planned

5. **Analytics Not Integrated**
   - Issue: Events logged to console, not PostHog/Amplitude
   - Impact: No metrics dashboards yet
   - Mitigation: Analytics instrumentation in Week 3

## 🎓 Training Materials

### For Customer Support

**How to Handle Disputes**:
1. Customer opens dispute via UI (within 7 days of completion)
2. Dispute appears in admin panel with status "disputed"
3. Review customer's reason and uploaded photos
4. Contact partner for their side of story
5. Make decision: `resolve_dispute_complete` or `resolve_dispute_refund`
6. Customer receives email notification
7. Refunds processed within 48 hours

**Common Scenarios**:
- Quality issues: Review photos, partial refund if warranted
- No-shows: Full refund, waive cancellation fee
- Late arrival: Discount on next service
- Damage claims: Escalate to manager

### For Partners

**New Workflow**:
1. Receive assignment notification (SMS/email)
2. Review order details in partner portal
3. Mark "En Route" when leaving for appointment
4. Mark "Arrived" when on-site
5. Mark "Start Cleaning" when beginning work
6. Mark "Complete" when finished
7. Upload completion photos (optional)

**Best Practices**:
- Update status in real-time for accurate ETAs
- Take before/after photos for quality assurance
- Communicate with customer if running late
- Report issues immediately (access problems, pet concerns, etc.)
