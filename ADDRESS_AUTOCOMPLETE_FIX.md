# Address Autocomplete Fix - Summary

**Date:** October 5, 2025  
**Time:** 15 minutes  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## Issue

Partner address fields in admin forms lacked Google Places autocomplete, resulting in:
- Manual typing of full addresses
- Potential typos and inconsistencies
- Slower data entry
- Poor UX compared to customer booking flow

---

## Solution

Added inline Google Places Autocomplete to both partner forms:
1. `app/admin/partners/new/page.tsx` - New partner form
2. `app/admin/partners/[id]/edit/page.tsx` - Edit partner form

### Implementation

Used ref-based initialization that:
- Detects existing Google Maps script
- Initializes autocomplete once per input
- Updates form state on place selection
- Gracefully falls back if unavailable

---

## Additional Fix

Fixed TypeScript build error in `app/api/partner/dashboard/route.ts`:
- **Issue:** `todayOrders` possibly undefined in reduce operation
- **Fix:** Changed `todayOrders?.filter().reduce()` to `(todayOrders || []).filter().reduce()`

---

## Testing

- ✅ Production build passes
- ✅ TypeScript type checking passes
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ Autocomplete functionality verified

---

## Impact

**User Experience:**
- Faster address entry with autocomplete
- Consistent address formatting
- Reduced typos
- Professional admin UX

**Data Quality:**
- Standardized formatting from Google
- Valid addresses
- Fewer manual entry errors
