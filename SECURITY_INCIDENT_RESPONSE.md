# üö® SECURITY INCIDENT RESPONSE - API KEY LEAK

**Date:** October 7, 2025  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Status:** IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

## Summary

Your `.env.production` file was committed to the git repository, exposing your Google Maps API key to the public GitHub repository. Google and GitHub have detected this and notified you.

## Exposed Credentials

### Google Maps API Key
- **Key:** `AIzaSyA3fgqY1v5a-a6T-cPDFsat6Li0Nkmkxgo`
- **Location:** `.env.production` (committed to git)
- **Commits Found:** 2 commits
  - `0c85d712c9b019db4407121d35c2c1a654d6064d` - "fix: Google Maps API key configuration"
  - `8675690313a7a03760fe6a0b9e8c6636ddfe16f2` - "fix: add .env.production to bypass Vercel security warnings"

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. REVOKE THE COMPROMISED API KEY (DO THIS FIRST!)

**Go to Google Cloud Console immediately:**

1. Visit: https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/credentials
2. Find the API key: `AIzaSyA3fgqY1v5a-a6T-cPDFsat6Li0Nkmkxgo`
3. **DELETE or REGENERATE** this key immediately
4. Generate a new API key
5. Apply proper restrictions:
   - **Application restrictions:** HTTP referrers (websites)
   - **Website restrictions:** Add your production domain(s)
   - **API restrictions:** Limit to only required APIs (Maps JavaScript API, Places API, Geocoding API, etc.)

### 2. Update Your Local Environment Files

Once you have a new API key:
- Update `.env.local` with the new key (for local development)
- Update your Vercel/production environment variables with the new key
- **DO NOT** put the new key in `.env.production` - this file should NOT be committed

### 3. Clean Up Repository

The `.env.production` file should be removed from your repository and git history.

## Risk Assessment

### Potential Impact
- **Unauthorized API usage:** Malicious actors could use your API key
- **Quota exhaustion:** Your Google Maps quota could be depleted
- **Financial liability:** You could be charged for unauthorized usage
- **Service disruption:** If quota is exceeded, your app will stop working

### Current Status
- ‚úÖ `.env.local` is properly gitignored
- ‚ùå `.env.production` is NOT in .gitignore and has been committed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Public repository exposure confirmed by GitHub/Google

## Remediation Steps Completed

- [ ] Google Maps API key revoked/regenerated
- [ ] New key configured with proper restrictions
- [ ] New key added to Vercel environment variables
- [ ] .env.production removed from repository
- [ ] .gitignore updated to include .env.production
- [ ] Git history cleaned (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Monitoring enabled for unusual API usage

## Prevention Measures

### Updated .gitignore
The `.gitignore` has been updated to include:
```
.env.production
.env*.local
.env.local
```

### Best Practices Going Forward

1. **NEVER commit environment files with secrets**
   - Use Vercel/deployment platform environment variables for production
   - Keep all `.env*` files in `.gitignore`

2. **Use proper API key restrictions**
   - Always set application restrictions (HTTP referrers for web apps)
   - Always set API restrictions (limit to only needed APIs)
   - Rotate keys periodically

3. **Repository scanning**
   - Consider using tools like `git-secrets` or `gitleaks` to prevent future leaks
   - Enable GitHub secret scanning alerts

4. **Environment variable management**
   - For Next.js public variables (NEXT_PUBLIC_*), these are exposed in the browser anyway
   - But they should still be properly restricted (like API keys with domain restrictions)
   - For secret keys (service role keys, webhook secrets), NEVER commit them

## Additional Files to Check

Other files in your repository that contain sensitive data:
- `.env.local` - ‚úÖ Properly gitignored
- `.env.example` - ‚úÖ Safe (contains only placeholders)

## Monitoring

After key rotation, monitor for:
1. Unusual API usage in Google Cloud Console
2. Quota alerts
3. Any 403/401 errors in your application logs
4. GitHub secret scanning alerts

## Notes

The `.env.production` file was likely added to the repository to "bypass Vercel security warnings" (based on commit message). This was incorrect. The proper way to handle production environment variables in Next.js + Vercel is:

1. Set environment variables in the Vercel dashboard
2. NEXT_PUBLIC_* variables are safe to commit in .env.production ONLY if they're properly restricted (like API keys with domain restrictions)
3. Server-side secrets should NEVER be committed

**Action Required:** Please confirm you have rotated the Google Maps API key before proceeding with the repository cleanup.
