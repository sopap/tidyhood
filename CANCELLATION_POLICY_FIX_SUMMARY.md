# Cancellation Policy Fix Summary

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Issue:** Hardcoded incorrect cancellation policy throughout SEO content  
**Severity:** Critical - Customer-facing policy mismatch

## Problem

During SEO content implementation, I mistakenly hardcoded cancellation policy fees as:
- **Wrong:** 25% cancellation fee, 50% no-show fee
- **Actual:** 5% cancellation fee (as shown in admin settings)

The cancellation policy is **dynamically managed** via `/admin/settings` and fetched through the `useCancellationPolicy` hook, which pulls data from the database. Hardcoding specific percentages in SEO copy defeats the purpose of having admin-configurable policies.

## What Was Fixed

### Files Modified

1. **app/book/laundry/page.tsx**
   - Removed hardcoded policy text: `"Reschedule free ≥24h; cancel ≥24h full refund; <24h 25% fee; no-show 50%"`
   - Replaced with: `"Policy: See cancellation terms below"`
   - The `<PolicyBanner>` component below already fetches and displays the current policy

2. **app/book/cleaning/page.tsx**
   - Removed same hardcoded policy text
   - Replaced with: `"Policy: See cancellation terms below"`
   - The `<PolicyBanner>` component displays the dynamic policy

3. **app/terms/page.tsx**
   - Removed all hardcoded percentage references (25%, 50%)
   - Updated Section 4 to reference dynamic policy:
     - "Our cancellation policy varies by service type and timing"
     - "Current cancellation fees and notice requirements are displayed during the booking process"
     - Added links to booking pages where dynamic `<PolicyBanner>` displays current policy

### Files Deleted

Removed all SEO deliverable documents that contained incorrect policy:
- `TIDYHOOD_FINAL_COPY_DELIVERABLE.md`
- `TIDYHOOD_CONTENT_STRATEGY.md`
- `CONTENT_STRATEGY_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`
- `CONTENT_STRATEGY_PHASES_1-5_COMPLETE.md`

## Solution Architecture

The correct implementation uses:

1. **Database-Driven Policy**: Policies stored in `cancellation_policies` table
2. **Admin Management**: Editable via `/admin/settings` interface
3. **Dynamic Display**: `<PolicyBanner>` component fetches current policy via API
4. **Fallback Text**: Generic language in static areas, specific details only where dynamic

### How PolicyBanner Works

```tsx
<PolicyBanner serviceType="LAUNDRY" />
// or
<PolicyBanner serviceType="CLEANING" />
```

This component:
- Calls `useCancellationPolicy(serviceType)` hook
- Fetches from `/api/admin/settings/policies`
- Displays current fee percentages
- Falls back to default policy if API fails

## Current Policy (as of Oct 19, 2025)

According to the admin settings screenshot:
- **Rescheduling:** Free with 24+ hours notice
- **Cancellations:** 5% fee if within 24 hours
- No mention of no-show fees in the UI

## Lessons Learned

1. **Never hardcode dynamic data in SEO copy** - Even if trying to be helpful for SEO
2. **Reference dynamic sources** - Link to booking pages where policy is displayed
3. **Use generic language in static pages** - Terms page should not specify percentages
4. **Trust the component system** - `<PolicyBanner>` was already built for this purpose

## Verification

To verify the fix:
1. Check `/book/laundry` - Should see `<PolicyBanner>` with current 5% fee
2. Check `/book/cleaning` - Should see `<PolicyBanner>` with current 5% fee  
3. Check `/terms` - Should reference booking pages, no hardcoded percentages
4. Admin can change policy at `/admin/settings` and it updates everywhere automatically
