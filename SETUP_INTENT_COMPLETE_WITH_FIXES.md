## ðŸ”§ Today's Critical Fixes

### Issue 1: Delivery Fee (Business Logic Error)
**Problem**: Laundry page charged "+$5 delivery fee"
**Root Cause**: Misunderstanding of service model
**Solution**:
- Removed delivery fee entirely
- Added green banner: "âœ“ Free Pickup & Delivery Included"
- Clarified standard turnaround: 2-3 business days

### Issue 2: Rush Service Implementation
**Added Feature**: 24-Hour Rush Service (+25%)
**Details**:
- Same-day return if pickup before 11 AM
- Next-day return if pickup after 11 AM
- Percentage-based pricing (scales with order size)
- Clear messaging and visual design

**Files Modified**:
- `app/book/laundry/page.tsx` - UI and state management
- `lib/pricing.ts` - 25% surcharge calculation
- `app/api/price/quote/route.ts` - API parameter handling

**Pricing Examples**:
- Standard (15 lbs): $26.25 (2-3 days)
- Rush (15 lbs): $32.81 (+$6.56, 24 hours)

### Issue 3: Pricing API Parameter Mismatch
**Problem**: Frontend sending `estimatedPounds`, API expecting `lbs`
**Solution**: Updated frontend to send correct parameter names
**Impact**: Pricing now calculates correctly, button enables properly

### Issue 4: Stripe Customer Mismatch
**Problem**: Saved payment method attached to different customer
**Root Cause**: Testing artifact from previous sessions
**Solution**: Added automatic payment method re-attachment in saga
**Implementation**: Detects mismatch, detaches, re-attaches to correct customer
