## 14. Rollback Procedures

### Pre-Rollback Checklist

**If critical issues found post-deployment:**

1. **Assess Severity**
   - [ ] Is production completely down?
   - [ ] Are users unable to complete orders?
   - [ ] Is data at risk?
   - [ ] Is there a workaround?

2. **Document Issue**
   - [ ] Screenshot errors
   - [ ] Copy console errors
   - [ ] Note affected features
   - [ ] Note number of affected users

3. **Communicate**
   - [ ] Notify team via Slack/Discord
   - [ ] Update status page (if available)
   - [ ] Prepare user communication

### Rollback Steps

#### Option 1: Git Revert (Preferred)

```bash
# 1. Identify commit to revert to
git log --oneline -10

# 2. Revert to previous stable version
git revert [commit-hash]

# 3. Push revert
git push origin main

# 4. Trigger new deployment
# (Vercel/Netlify will auto-deploy, or manually trigger)

# 5. Verify rollback successful
curl https://[your-domain]/api/health
```

#### Option 2: Database Rollback

```bash
# If database migration caused issues:

# 1. Connect to database
psql $DATABASE_URL

# 2. Identify last migration
SELECT * FROM supabase_migrations.schema_migrations 
ORDER BY version DESC LIMIT 5;

# 3. Run rollback migration (if exists)
# e.g., supabase/migrations/010_unified_order_status_rollback.sql

# 4. Verify data integrity
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;
```

#### Option 3: Vercel/Netlify Rollback

```bash
# Vercel
vercel rollback [deployment-url]

# Or via dashboard:
# 1. Go to Vercel dashboard
# 2. Select project
# 3. Go to Deployments
# 4. Find previous stable deployment
# 5. Click "Promote to Production"
```

### Post-Rollback Steps

1. **Verify System Stability**
   - [ ] Run smoke tests
   - [ ] Check error monitoring (Sentry, etc.)
   - [ ] Monitor API response times
   - [ ] Check database connections

2. **Investigate Root Cause**
   - [ ] Review failed deployment logs
   - [ ] Identify what broke
   - [ ] Determine why tests didn't catch it
   - [ ] Document lessons learned

3. **Plan Fix**
   - [ ] Create bug ticket
   - [ ] Assign priority
   - [ ] Develop fix in staging
   - [ ] Re-run full test suite
   - [ ] Deploy fix with monitoring

4. **Update Documentation**
   - [ ] Add regression test for this issue
   - [ ] Update deployment checklist
   - [ ] Document rollback in changelog

### Monitoring After Deployment

**First 30 minutes:**
- [ ] Monitor error rates
- [ ] Check API response times
- [ ] Watch user session analytics
- [ ] Monitor payment success rates

**First 24 hours:**
- [ ] Review error logs
