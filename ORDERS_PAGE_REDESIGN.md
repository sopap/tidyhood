# My Orders Page Redesign

## Overview
Complete redesign of the My Orders page to be faster to scan, shorter in vertical length, and optimized for mobile devices.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Compact Design**
- Reduced card height from ~150px to ~80px per order
- Changed padding from `p-6` to `p-3`
- Condensed content to 2-3 lines per card
- Overall page height reduced by approximately 60%

### 2. **Smart Grouping**
Orders are now grouped into 4 sections:
- **Upcoming Pickups**: Future scheduled orders (`pending_pickup` with future dates)
- **In Progress**: Active orders being processed (`at_facility`, `paid_processing`)
- **Completed**: Recent finished orders from last 30 days (`completed`, `awaiting_payment`)
- **Past Orders**: Orders older than 30 days (collapsed by default)

### 3. **User-Friendly Status Labels**
Replaced database status keys with clear labels:
- `pending_pickup` → "Pickup Scheduled" (blue)
- `at_facility` / `paid_processing` → "In Progress" (indigo)
- `awaiting_payment` → "Awaiting Payment" (yellow)
- `completed` → "Completed" (green)
- `canceled` → "Canceled" (gray)

### 4. **Mobile Optimization**
- **Sticky Bottom CTA**: Fixed position bar with "Book Laundry" and "Book Cleaning" buttons (mobile only)
- **Tappable Cards**: Entire card surface is clickable/tappable
- **Large Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px height for all interactive elements
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts seamlessly from mobile to desktop

### 5. **Progressive Disclosure**
- Each section shows 3-5 items initially
- "Show more" button loads additional items (3 at a time)
- Sections can be collapsed/expanded
- Past Orders section collapsed by default

### 6. **Accessibility Features**
- Semantic HTML with proper heading hierarchy (`<h1>`, `<h2>`)
- ARIA labels on all interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support (Enter/Space keys)
- Focus indicators on all controls
- Status not conveyed by color alone
- Screen reader friendly

## Files Created

### Components
- `components/orders/OrderCard.tsx` - Compact, tappable order card (2-3 lines)
- `components/orders/StatusBadge.tsx` - Color-coded status indicators
- `components/orders/Section.tsx` - Collapsible section with pagination
- `components/orders/StickyActions.tsx` - Mobile sticky bottom CTA
- `components/orders/EmptyState.tsx` - Empty state for new users

### Utilities
- `lib/orders.ts` - Grouping logic, formatters, status mapping

### Types
- Added `OrderStatus` and `Order` types to `lib/types.ts`

### Main Page
- `app/orders/page.tsx` - Redesigned with new components

## Technical Details

### Component Architecture
```
OrdersPage
├── Header
├── Recurring Plans (kept from original)
├── Sections (4)
│   ├── OrderCards (clickable)
│   │   └── StatusBadges
│   ├── Show More Button
│   └── Collapse/Expand Toggle
├── Help Section
└── StickyActions (mobile only)
```

### Grouping Logic
```typescript
// Orders are grouped based on status + date:
- Upcoming: pending_pickup + future date
- In Progress: at_facility || paid_processing
- Completed: (completed || awaiting_payment) + last 30 days
- Past: everything older than 30 days
```

### Performance
- Client-side pagination using array slicing
- Initial render shows minimal items (3-5 per section)
- Progressive loading with "Show more"
- API already supports pagination for future optimization

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Long, flat list of all orders
- Large cards with excessive whitespace
- No mobile optimization
- Verbose content (4+ lines per card)
- Hard to scan quickly

### After
- Organized into meaningful sections
- Compact cards with essential info only
- Mobile-first with sticky CTA
- Quick scan with 2-3 lines per card
- Much shorter page overall

## Backward Compatibility

✅ Existing API unchanged
✅ All existing routes preserved
✅ Recurring plans display maintained
✅ All order statuses supported
✅ Error handling preserved

## Testing Checklist
