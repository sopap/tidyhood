# Post-Mortem: Production Environment Validation Failures

**Date:** October 6, 2025  
**Incident Duration:** ~45 minutes  
**Severity:** High (Production API failures)  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Resolved

---

## Executive Summary

Production deployment resulted in 500 Internal Server Errors on critical API endpoints (`/api/orders` and `/api/recurring/plan`) due to an invalid `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable format. The issue was masked by Vercel's build cache, requiring 6 deployment attempts and ~60 minutes of debugging before resolution.

**Root Cause:** Optional environment variable (`STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`) was set in Vercel but with an invalid format (didn't start with `whsec_`), causing Zod validation to fail.

**Resolution:** Deleted the invalid `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` from Vercel and redeployed with cache cleared.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The 5 Whys

1. **Why did production fail?**  
   ‚Üí Environment validation failed with 500 errors

2. **Why did environment validation fail?**  
   ‚Üí `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` had an invalid format (didn't start with `whsec_`)

3. **Why wasn't this caught earlier?**  
   ‚Üí Vercel's build cache served old code that didn't show detailed error messages

4. **Why did it take 6 commits to find?**  
   ‚Üí Original error message was generic: "Environment validation failed. Fix the errors above and restart." No details about which variable or why.

5. **Why was an invalid value set in production?**  
   ‚Üí No validation in the deployment process; manual env var management in Vercel dashboard allows invalid values.

### System Failure, Not Human Error

This was a **system design failure**, not an individual mistake:
- ‚úÖ System allowed invalid environment variable values
- ‚úÖ System cached builds, hiding actual error messages
- ‚úÖ System provided poor error feedback
- ‚úÖ No pre-deployment validation

---

## What Went Well ‚úÖ

1. **Excellent Error Logging (Added During Debugging)**
   - The improved `lib/env.ts` now shows detailed validation errors
   - Example: `"STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET: Invalid input: must start with 'whsec_'"`
   - This will catch future issues in seconds, not hours

2. **Systematic Debugging Approach**
   - Fixed several real issues along the way:
     - Zod syntax errors (`.default()` placement)
     - Missing defaults for optional variables
     - Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALLOWED_ZIPS` default
   - Even though these weren't the root cause, they were genuine improvements

3. **No Data Loss or Security Impact**
   - Read-only endpoints affected
   - No payment processing impacted
   - No customer data exposed

4. **Fast Recovery Once Root Cause Found**
   - From identifying STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET issue to resolution: 3 minutes
   - Clear path to fix once error was visible

5. **Documentation Created During Incident**
   - Better understanding of env validation
   - Improved debugging procedures
   - This post-mortem!

---

## What Didn't Go Well ‚ùå

1. **Build Cache Masked the Real Error**
   - 5 deployments served cached builds
   - Actual error not visible until cache cleared
   - Lost ~30 minutes debugging wrong issues

2. **No Pre-Deployment Validation**
   - Invalid env var existed in Vercel for unknown duration
   - No automated checks before deploy
   - Manual env var management error-prone

3. **Generic Error Messages Initially**
   - "Environment validation failed" without details
   - Couldn't identify which variable or why
   - Required detective work to find issue

4. **No Staging Environment**
   - Deployed straight to production
   - Would have caught issue in staging
   - No safe testing ground for env changes

5. **Lack of Monitoring/Alerting**
   - No automated alerts for 500 errors
   - No health checks after deployment
   - Relied on user report to discover issue

## Technical Details

### Files Modified (6 Commits)

1. **app/api/recurring/plan/route.ts**
   - Added authentication check
   - Improved error handling

2. **lib/auth.ts**
   - Better error messages
   - More graceful failure modes

3. **lib/env.ts** (Multiple improvements)
   - Fixed Zod syntax: `.default()` before `.transform()`
   - Made optional variables: TWILIO_*, ADMIN_EMAIL, SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
   - Added defaults: NEXT_PUBLIC_ALLOWED_ZIPS, NYC_TAX_RATE, FIRST_ORDER_CAP_CENTS, LAUNDRY_MIN_LBS
   - Improved error logging with detailed messages

### Environment Variables Fixed

**Made Optional:**
- TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID
- TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN
- TWILIO_FROM_PHONE
- STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
- ADMIN_EMAIL
- SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL
- NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL

**Added Defaults:**
- NEXT_PUBLIC_ALLOWED_ZIPS = "10026,10027,10030"
- NYC_TAX_RATE = "0.08875"
- FIRST_ORDER_CAP_CENTS = "7500"
- LAUNDRY_MIN_LBS = "10"
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME = "Tidyhood"
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL = "https://www.tidyhood.nyc"

### The Invalid Variable

```typescript
// lib/env.ts
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET: z.string().startsWith('whsec_').optional()

// Vercel had: (some other format, maybe sk_test_...)
// Should be: whsec_... OR deleted entirely if not using webhooks
```

## Lessons Learned

### Key Takeaways

1. **"Environment validation failed" is useless without details**
   - Always show which variable and why it failed
   - Our improved error logging is the most valuable outcome

2. **Build caches hide problems**
   - Always clear cache when debugging env issues
   - Consider disabling cache for critical deploys

3. **Optional variables still validate when set**
   - `.optional()` means "can be missing"
   - If present, value must still be valid format
   - Delete invalid values rather than leaving them

4. **Manual env management is error-prone**
   - Human error when entering values
   - No format validation in Vercel UI
   - Need automated validation

5. **Fail fast, fail loudly**
   - App correctly refused to start with invalid config
   - Better than running with wrong settings
   - Clear errors speed up debugging

### Process Improvements

**Before This Incident:**
- Generic error: "Environment validation failed"
- No details about which variable
- Manual env var management
- No pre-deploy validation
- Deploy straight to production

**After This Incident:**
- Specific error: "STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET: Invalid input: must start with 'whsec_'"
- Lists both missing and invalid variables
- Documented format requirements
- Checklist for deployments
- Plan for automated validation
- Improved debugging procedures

## Testing Strategy

### Local Testing (Before Deploy)

```bash
# 1. Test with production-like environment
cp .env.example .env.production.test

# 2. Fill with VALID dummy values
# - Use correct formats (e.g., whsec_test123 for webhook secret)
# - Don't leave optional vars with invalid formats

# 3. Build and validate
npm run build

# 4. Check for environment validation errors
# Should see NO errors if all formats are correct
```

### CI/CD Testing (Automated)

```bash
# Run in GitHub Actions before deploy
node scripts/validate-env.js

# This will:
# - Check all required vars are set
# - Validate formats match expected patterns
# - Exit with error if validation fails
# - Block deployment
```

### Staging Testing (Manual)

```bash
# 1. Deploy to staging first
vercel --prod=false

# 2. Test critical endpoints
curl https://staging.tidyhood.nyc/api/orders
curl https://staging.tidyhood.nyc/api/recurring/plan

# 3. Verify 200 OK responses

# 4. Only then deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

## Monitoring & Alerting

### What We're Adding

1. **Sentry Error Tracking**
   ```javascript
   // Captures all 500 errors in production
   // Alerts team in Slack
   // Groups by error type
   ```

2. **Health Check Endpoint**
   ```javascript
   // GET /api/health
   // Validates environment on startup
   // Returns 200 OK if all good
   // Returns 500 with details if env invalid
   ```

3. **Post-Deploy Monitoring**
   ```javascript
   // Watch error rates for 10 minutes after deploy
   // Auto-rollback if error rate > 5%
   // Alert team if anomalies detected
   ```

4. **Vercel Log Alerts**
   ```javascript
   // Slack notification on deployment
   // Include link to logs
   // Flag any errors in first 5 minutes
   ```

## Incident Response Procedures

### If This Happens Again

#### Step 1: Immediate Triage (5 min)
1. Check Vercel logs for error details
2. Look for "Environment validation failed" message
3. Note which variables are mentioned
4. Check Vercel dashboard for those variables

#### Step 2: Quick Validation (5 min)
1. Compare variable VALUES against format requirements
2. Check ENV_VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md for expected formats
3. Look for variables that don't match patterns

#### Step 3: Fix & Deploy (5 min)
1. Fix or delete invalid variables in Vercel
2. Click "Redeploy" with cache cleared
3. Monitor logs for detailed error messages
4. Verify 200 OK responses on affected endpoints

#### Step 4: Verify (5 min)
1. Test all affected endpoints
2. Check error rates in monitoring
3. Verify no customer impact
4. Confirm rollback plan if needed

**Total Time to Resolution: < 20 minutes**
