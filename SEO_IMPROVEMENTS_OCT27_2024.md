## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Action Required

### Google Search Console Verification Code

**MUST BE DONE BEFORE DEPLOYMENT:**

1. **Get your verification code:**
   - Go to https://search.google.com/search-console
   - Add property for `https://tidyhood.nyc`
   - Choose "HTML tag" verification method
   - Copy the verification code (looks like: `gRQ8sJxxx...`)

2. **Update the code in `app/layout.tsx` (line 67):**

```typescript
// CURRENT (PLACEHOLDER - WILL NOT WORK):
verification: {
  google: 'your-google-verification-code',
}

// CHANGE TO:
verification: {
  google: 'gRQ8sJxxx...', // Your actual code here
}
```

3. **Deploy and verify:**
   - Deploy changes to production
   - Return to Google Search Console
   - Click "Verify"

**Without this step, Google Search Console won't be able to verify your site ownership!**
