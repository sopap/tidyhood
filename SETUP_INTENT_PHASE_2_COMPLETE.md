**Status**: API updates complete  
**Time Invested**: ~1 hour (faster than estimated!)  
**Cumulative Time**: ~7 hours total  
**Remaining**: ~8 hours (Phases 3-4)

## ✅ Phase 2 Complete: API Updates

### Files Modified/Created (4 tasks)

#### 1. ✅ Webhook Handler Already Updated
**File**: `app/api/webhooks/stripe-payment/route.ts`
- SetupIntent event handlers already in place:
  - `setup_intent.setup_failed` - Card validation failed
  - `setup_intent.succeeded` - Card saved successfully
- Updated `payment_intent.payment_failed` for final charge failures
- Proper error classification and logging

#### 2. ✅ Cleanup Complete
- Deleted `app/api/cron/auth-expiry-check/` (SetupIntents don't expire!)
- Old `authorize` endpoint already removed
- Old `auth-complete` page already cleaned up

#### 3. ✅ Setup Complete Page Created
**File**: `app/orders/[id]/setup-complete/page.tsx`
- Handles SetupIntent redirect after 3DS
- Shows loading/success/error states
- Polls order status for confirmation
- Auto-redirects to order page
- Clear messaging: "$0.00 charged now, exact amount after service"

#### 4. ✅ Failed Charge Recovery Endpoint Created
**File**: `app/api/orders/[id]/request-payment/route.ts`

**Features**:
- POST: Request payment retry
  - Sends SMS with payment link
  - Starts 24h grace period
  - Logs all events
- GET: Check grace period status
  - Returns remaining time
  - Status checks
- CRON handler: Process expired grace periods
  - Apply no-show fee
  - Update order status

**SMS Flow**:
```
Charge fails → SMS sent immediately
"Your laundry quote ($XX) is ready but payment failed. 
Please update your payment method by [time] [date] 
to avoid a $25 no-show fee: [link]"

Grace period: 24 hours
If not resolved → Apply $25 no-show fee → Cancel order
```

## 🚀 Phase 3: Integration (4 hours)

### 3.1 Update StripePaymentCollector (30 min)

You'll be charged $0 now and the exact amount after service."
```

**Remove**:
- Authorization amount display
- Buffer percentage explanation
- "Authorized amount" terminology

- Auto-charge if variance ≤20%

### 3.4 Update Cancellation Flow (30 min)
**Simplification**: No authorization to release!

**Changes**:
- Remove "release authorization" logic
- Just delete order or apply cancellation fee
- Simpler state transitions

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### SetupIntent Flow
```typescript
1. Customer books
2. Create draft order
3. SetupIntent.create() → Save card
4. SetupIntent.confirm() → Validate card
5. $0.01 charge → Instant refund
6. Finalize order (pending_pickup)
7. Customer sees: "$0.00 charged - Confirmed!"
```

### Failed Charge Flow
```typescript
1. Partner quotes $50 (variance ≤20%)
2. Auto-charge $50 with saved_payment_method_id
3. Charge fails (2-3% of cases)
4. Webhook → POST /api/orders/[id]/request-payment
5. SMS sent with payment link
6. 24h grace period starts
7. Customer updates payment → Retry → Success (70% of failed)
8. Grace period expires → Apply $25 no-show fee (30% of failed)
```
