# Guest Booking & Conversion Optimization Implementation

**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Status:** âœ… PHASE 1 COMPLETE  
**Goal:** Remove login wall, enable guest checkout, improve conversion rate

---

## Problem Analysis

**Current State:**
- Hard login wall blocks 100% of unauthenticated users
- "Log In to Complete Booking" button shown instead of guest option
- Backend supports guest bookings (Migration 035) but UI doesn't expose it
- Estimated 2% conversion rate

**Root Cause:**
Lines 611-622 in `app/book/cleaning/page.tsx` force login before booking
