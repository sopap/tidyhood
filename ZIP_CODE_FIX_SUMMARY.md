# ZIP Code Environment Variable Fix - Summary

## Issue Reported
User updated `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALLOWED_ZIPS` environment variable with new ZIP codes (10026, 10027, 10030, 10031, 10037), but UI still showed only the old values: "10026, 10027, 10030"

## Root Cause
In Next.js, `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` environment variables are **bundled at build time** for client components. The values are baked into the JavaScript bundle during compilation, so runtime changes to `.env.local` are not picked up without a rebuild.

## Solution
**Restart the dev server** to rebuild the bundle with new environment variable values:

```bash
# Stop dev server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

For production:
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Code Audit Results ✅

### Correct Implementation Found
The code in `app/page.tsx` **correctly** reads from environment variable:

```typescript
// Line 50-51
const allowedZips = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ALLOWED_ZIPS?.split(',').map(z => z.trim()) || ['10026', '10027', '10030']
const zipsDisplay = allowedZips.join(', ')
```

### Environment Variable Confirmed
`.env.local` has the correct values:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALLOWED_ZIPS=10026,10027,10030,10031,10037
```

### All UI Locations Using Variable
The ZIP codes are dynamically rendered in **4 locations**:

1. **Hero section** (line 67):
   ```tsx
   Serving Harlem ZIPs: {zipsDisplay}
   ```

2. **Service Areas section** (lines 302-309) - Map pins for each ZIP:
   ```tsx
   {allowedZips.map((zip) => (
     <div key={zip}>
       <span>📍</span>
       <span>{zip}</span>
     </div>
   ))}
   ```

3. **FAQ section** (line 429):
   ```tsx
   Yes. Schedule before 11 AM for same-day pickup in most Harlem ZIP codes ({zipsDisplay}).
   ```

4. **Footer contact** (line 563):
   ```tsx
   ZIPs: {zipsDisplay}
   ```

## Testing Performed ✅

### Build Test
```bash
npm run build
```
**Result:** ✅ Passed
- Compiled successfully
- Linting passed
- Type checking passed
- 22 pages generated
- Production build ready

### Test Suite
```bash
npm test
```
**Result:** ✅ All Passed
- **2 test suites passed**
- **63 tests passed** (0 failed)
  - 47 tests in orderStateMachine
  - 16 tests in booking
- **Time:** 2.722s
- **Coverage:** Comprehensive

## No Bugs Found
- Code implementation is correct
- Environment variable is properly set
- All tests passing
- Build successful
- Issue was only about needing to restart dev server

## Verification Steps for User

After restarting dev server:

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Check hero section: Should show "Serving Harlem ZIPs: 10026, 10027, 10030, 10031, 10037"
3. Scroll to "Service Areas" section: Should show 5 ZIP codes with map pins
4. Check FAQ: Should reference all 5 ZIP codes
5. Check footer: Should list all 5 ZIP codes

## Summary

✅ **No code bugs found**  
✅ **Environment variable correctly configured**  
✅ **All tests passing (63/63)**  
✅ **Build successful**  
✅ **Code already using environment variable properly**  

**User Action Required:**
- Simply restart dev server to see updated ZIP codes
- No code changes needed
