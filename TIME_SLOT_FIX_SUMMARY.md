# Time Slot Auto-Selection Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
When Rush service is NOT selected:
- Delivery date shows 10/10/2025 (only 24h after pickup)
- No delivery time slot is selected
- Should show 10/11/2025 (48h after pickup at 4 PM)

When Rush IS selected:
- Works correctly: Shows 10/11/2025 with time slot selected
- This is 24h after pickup, which is correct for rush

## Root Cause
The `useEffect` that finds the earliest delivery date runs based on `[selectedSlot, rushService, address]` dependencies. The logic is correct, but there may be a race condition or the date isn't being set properly when the page first loads without rush selected.

## Solution
Ensure the delivery date search logic properly validates:
1. Calculate minimum delivery time based on pickup slot end + 48h (or 24h for rush)
2. Search dates starting from that minimum
3. For each date, validate that at least ONE slot meets the time requirement
4. Only select a date if valid slots exist
5. Auto-select the earliest valid time slot
