# Phase 1 Week 3: Capacity Management - COMPLETE ✅

**Date:** January 5, 2025  
**Status:** Production Ready  
**Build:** ✅ Compiled Successfully  

---

## 🎉 Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented complete capacity management system for TidyHood operations team to manage partner availability and time slots.

---

## 📦 What Was Built

### **1. Database Infrastructure**

**Migration:** `016_capacity_calendar.sql`

**New Table:** `capacity_calendar`
- Stores individual time slots for partners
- Tracks reserved vs. available capacity
- Prevents overlapping slots with unique index
- Includes RLS policies for admin/partner/public access
- Helper function for conflict detection

**Schema:**
```sql
- id: UUID
- partner_id: UUID (FK to partners)
- service_type: LAUNDRY | CLEANING
- slot_start: TIMESTAMPTZ
- slot_end: TIMESTAMPTZ
- max_units: INT (orders or minutes)
- reserved_units: INT (currently booked)
- notes: TEXT
- created_by: UUID (admin who created)
- created_at/updated_at: TIMESTAMPTZ
```

---

### **2. API Endpoints (6 total)**

#### **Slot CRUD Operations:**

**`GET /api/admin/capacity/slots`**
- Lists all capacity slots with filters
- Query params: `partner_id`, `service_type`, `start_date`, `end_date`
- Returns slots with availability calculations
- Joins partner information

**`POST /api/admin/capacity/slots`**
- Creates new capacity slot
- Validates: partner exists, active, no conflicts, future dates
- Uses database conflict detection function
- Audit logging

**`GET /api/admin/capacity/slots/[id]`**
- Fetches single slot with details
- Includes availability calculations
- Partner information included

**`PUT /api/admin/capacity/slots/[id]`**
- Updates existing slot
- Cannot reduce capacity below reserved
- Checks for conflicts if times change
- Audit logging

**`DELETE /api/admin/capacity/slots/[id]`**
- Deletes slot if no reservations
- Prevents deletion of slots with bookings
- Audit logging

**`POST /api/admin/capacity/bulk`**
- Generates multiple slots from template
- Reads from `capacity_templates` table
- Creates slots for matching days of week
- 90-day maximum range
- Conflict detection before bulk insert
- Batch operations for performance

---

### **2. Capacity Calculations**
- Available units = max_units - reserved_units
- Utilization percentage
- Status determination (available/partial/full)
- Real-time calculations on every fetch

### **3. Audit Logging**
- All create/update/delete operations logged
- Actor tracking (admin user ID)
- Change tracking (before/after)
- Action types: `capacity.create`, `capacity.update`, `capacity.delete`, `capacity.bulk_create`

### **4. Validation & Security**
- Admin-only access (all endpoints)
- Partner must be active
- Service type must match partner
- Slots must be in future
- Cannot reduce capacity below reserved
- Cannot delete slots with reservations

### **5. Data Integrity**
- Unique index prevents duplicate slots
- Check constraints enforce valid data
- Foreign key constraints
- RLS policies active
- Transaction safety

   - UI for editing coming in future phase

2. **No Calendar View**
   - List view only for now
   - Calendar view planned (feature flag ready)

3. **Manual Bulk Generation**
   - Requires template ID
   - UI for template management coming next

4. **90-Day Bulk Limit**
   - Prevents performance issues
   - Can run multiple times for longer ranges

5. **No Real-Time Updates**
   - Manual refresh required
   - WebSocket support planned for Phase 2

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Issue:** Migration fails  
**Solution:** Check Supabase connection, verify `update_updated_at_column()` function exists

**Issue:** Slots don't appear in list  
**Solution:** Check date range filter, verify RLS policies, check admin role

**Issue:** Conflict detection too strict  
**Solution:** Review database function logic, check for timezone issues

**Issue:** Delete button always disabled  
**Solution:** Verify `reserved_units` is 0, check button disable logic

**Issue:** Build errors  
**Solution:** Run `npm install`, check TypeScript version, verify imports
