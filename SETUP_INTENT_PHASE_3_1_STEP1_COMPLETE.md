**Feature Flag**: ENABLED in `.env.local`

---

## ✅ Completed Work

### 1. Cleaning Booking Page Integration

**File**: `app/book/cleaning/page.tsx`

#### Changes Made:
1. ✅ Added Stripe Elements provider and initialization
2. ✅ Imported StripePaymentCollector component
3. ✅ Added Setup Intent state management (paymentMethodId, paymentError, isSetupIntentFlow)
4. ✅ Implemented feature flag check on component mount
5. ✅ Added 3DS redirect handling (setup_intent_client_secret URL params)
6. ✅ Created dual-flow submit handler:
   - **Setup Intent Flow**: Calls `/api/payment/setup` with payment method
   - **Legacy Flow**: Calls `/api/orders` for deferred payment
7. ✅ Added Payment Method Collection UI section (conditional on feature flag)
8. ✅ Enhanced submit button validation and messaging
9. ✅ Added dual payment messaging based on active flow

#### Testing Results:
- ✅ **Feature Flag OFF**: Deferred payment flow works (order created without payment)
- ⏳ **Feature Flag ON**: Needs server restart to test payment collection

### 2. Payment Setup API Enhancement

**File**: `app/api/payment/setup/route.ts`

#### Changes Made:
1. ✅ Added support for CLEANING service type
2. ✅ Added 'standard' to service_category enum
3. ✅ Added subscription_id support for recurring cleaning
4. ✅ Made details parameter flexible (z.any()) to support both LAUNDRY and CLEANING

### 3. Payment Saga Type Fix

**File**: `lib/payment-saga.ts`

#### Changes Made:
1. ✅ Added 'standard' to service_category union type
2. ✅ Now supports both LAUNDRY and CLEANING service types

### 4. Feature Flag Configuration

**File**: `.env.local`

#### Changes Made:
1. ✅ Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_SETUP_INTENT_ENABLED=true`

## 🔄 How to Test Setup Intent Flow

### Step 1: Restart Dev Server
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C in terminal)
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Navigate to Cleaning Booking
```
http://localhost:3000/book/cleaning
```

### Step 3: Fill Out Form

2. Select home size (bedrooms/bathrooms)
3. Choose cleaning type and any add-ons
4. Select a date and time slot

## 📋 Pending Work

### Immediate: Laundry Booking Page

**File**: `app/book/laundry/page.tsx` (currently a placeholder)

Need to create complete laundry booking page with same Setup Intent integration:
- Copy structure from cleaning page
- Adapt for laundry-specific fields (weight tier, service type)
- Integrate StripePaymentCollector
- Implement dual-flow submit handler
- Add 3DS redirect handling

**Estimated Time**: 1 hour

### Phase 3.2: Partner Quote Logic Updates

**File**: `app/api/partner/orders/[id]/quote/route.ts`

Remove authorization limit checks, update to variance-based approval.

**Estimated Time**: 1 hour

### Phase 3.3: Cancellation Flow Simplification

**File**: `app/api/orders/[id]/cancel.ts`

Remove auth release logic since there's no authorization to release.

**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes

### Phase 4: Testing & Documentation

Comprehensive testing and documentation creation.

**Estimated Time**: 4 hours

---

## 🎯 Current Progress

**Phase 3.1**: 50% Complete (Cleaning page ✅, Laundry page pending)  
**Overall Phase 3**: 15% Complete  
**Overall Phases 3 & 4**: 10% Complete

**Time Invested Today**: ~2 hours  
**Remaining Time Estimate**: ~7 hours

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Non-Blocking Issues:
1. `/api/orders` 500 error when prefilling from last order - doesn't affect bookings
2. Stripe.js HTTP warning - expected in dev, requires HTTPS in production
3. Google Maps deprecation warnings - informational only

### To Fix Later:
- The `/api/orders` GET 500 error should be investigated
- Consider migrating to PlaceAutocompleteElement per Google's recommendation

## 🚀 Next Actions

### For Me (Cline):

3. Continue with Phase 3.2 (partner quote logic)
4. Continue with Phase 3.3 (cancellation simplification)

## 💡 Key Implementation Details

### Dual Flow Architecture

**When Flag OFF (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SETUP_INTENT_ENABLED=false`):**
```javascript
// OLD FLOW
POST /api/orders → Create order → Redirect to order page
// Payment happens later on order detail page
```

**When Flag ON (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SETUP_INTENT_ENABLED=true`):**
```javascript
// NEW FLOW
POST /api/payment/setup → 
  Execute Saga:
    1. Create draft order
    2. Save payment method (SetupIntent)
    3. Validate card ($0.01 charge + refund)
    4. Finalize order (status: pending_pickup)
  → Redirect to order page
// Customer charged later after service completion
```

### Payment Collection UI

Only shows when:
- ✅ Feature flag is enabled
- ✅ Address is valid
- ✅ Time slot is selected
- ✅ Pricing is calculated

### User Experience

**Setup Intent Enabled**:
- 💳 "Secure Booking" badge
- Payment method input fields
- "$0.00 charged now" messaging
- Card validated immediately
- Can charge ANY amount later (no Stripe limits)

**Setup Intent Disabled**:
- 💰 "Pay After Service" badge
- NO payment method collection
- "No payment required now" messaging
- Traditional deferred payment

---

## 🔐 Security & Reliability

- ✅ Saga pattern ensures atomic operations
- ✅ Circuit breaker prevents Stripe API overload
- ✅ Quota manager prevents rate limit errors
- ✅ Feature flag allows safe rollback
- ✅ Backward compatible with existing flow
- ✅ 3DS authentication supported

---

**Status**: Ready for user testing. Please restart dev server and test the cleaning booking page with payment collection enabled.
