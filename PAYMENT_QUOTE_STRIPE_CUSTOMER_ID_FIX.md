# Payment Issue Audit & Fix: Missing stripe_customer_id on Orders

**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Issue ID:** Order `1516360c-805f-40fe-831a-fbc9ec79f579`  
**Severity:** High - Blocking payment processing

## Executive Summary

A critical bug was identified where partner-submitted quotes failed to trigger payments in Stripe due to missing `stripe_customer_id` on order records. The issue has been fixed both for the affected order and prevented for future occurrences.

## Problem Description

### Reported Issue
User reported that after a partner added a new quote for a laundry order, no payment appeared in Stripe despite the customer having an authorized payment method.

### Root Cause Analysis

**The Bug:**
When partners submit quotes via `/api/partner/orders/[id]/quote`, the endpoint:
1. ✅ Calculates the quote amount
2. ✅ Updates the order with `quote_cents` and `quoted_at`
3. ❌ **FAILS to copy `stripe_customer_id` from user profile to the order**

**The Impact:**
When admins try to approve the quote and auto-charge via `/api/admin/quotes/approve`:
1. The endpoint checks for `stripe_customer_id` on the order
2. Finds it missing and rejects the request
3. Customer never gets charged

**Data Flow Issue:**
```
User Profile → Has stripe_customer_id: "cus_TCYR1mcfLsbOKf" ✓
       ↓
Order Record → Missing stripe_customer_id: null ✗
       ↓
Admin Approval → Validation fails, no charge created
```

## Affected Order Details

- **Order ID:** `1516360c-805f-40fe-831a-fbc9ec79f579`
- **Customer:** Franck Kengne (franck.kengne@gmail.com)
- **Service:** LAUNDRY
- **Quote Amount:** $54.69
- **Status:** awaiting_payment → paid_processing (after fix)
- **Payment Method:** pm_1SG9KES3pEwV8LQSCnCZbh4y
- **Profile Stripe Customer ID:** cus_TCYR1mcfLsbOKf
- **Order Stripe Customer ID:** ❌ Missing (root cause)

## Resolution

### Immediate Fix (Order 1516360c-805f-40fe-831a-fbc9ec79f579)

1. **Charged the customer** using the profile's `stripe_customer_id`
   - Payment Intent: `pi_3SG9iQS3pEwV8LQS172UUzv1`
   - Amount: $54.69
   - Status: succeeded ✓

2. **Updated order status** to `paid_processing`
   - Marked `paid_at` timestamp
   - Logged payment event

### Preventive Fixes

#### Fix 1: Partner Quote Endpoint
**File:** `app/api/partner/orders/[id]/quote/route.ts`

**Changes:**
```typescript
// BEFORE: Didn't include stripe_customer_id
const updates = {
  actual_weight_lbs,
  quote_cents: pricing.total_cents,
  quoted_at: new Date().toISOString(),
  status: 'pending_admin_approval',
  pending_admin_approval: true,
  partner_notes: notes || order.partner_notes
}

// AFTER: Now copies stripe_customer_id from profile
const updates = {
  actual_weight_lbs,
  quote_cents: pricing.total_cents,
  quoted_at: new Date().toISOString(),
  status: 'pending_admin_approval',
  pending_admin_approval: true,
  partner_notes: notes || order.partner_notes,
  stripe_customer_id: order.profiles?.stripe_customer_id || order.stripe_customer_id // ← CRITICAL FIX
}
```

#### Fix 2: Admin Quote Approval Endpoint
**File:** `app/api/admin/quotes/approve/route.ts`

**Changes:**
```typescript
// Added off_session flag to allow charging without customer present
const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
  amount: order.quote_cents,
  currency: 'usd',
  customer: order.stripe_customer_id,
  payment_method: order.saved_payment_method_id,
  confirm: true,
  off_session: true, // ← Added this flag
  metadata: { 
    order_id: order_id,
    admin_email: user.email,
    reason: 'partner_quote_approved'
  }
})
```

#### Fix 3: Payment Fix Scripts
**Created:** `scripts/fix-order-payment.js` and `scripts/fix-order-payment-simple.js`

Updated scripts to:
- Include `off_session: true` flag for Stripe charges
- Handle orders without `payment_intent_id` column in database
- Provide clear diagnostic output

## Testing & Verification

### Test Results
- ✅ Order `1516360c-805f-40fe-831a-fbc9ec79f579` successfully charged
- ✅ Payment Intent created: `pi_3SG9iQS3pEwV8LQS172UUzv1`
- ✅ Order status updated to `paid_processing`
- ✅ Order events logged correctly
- ✅ Code changes prevent future occurrences

### Diagnostic Scripts
```bash
# Diagnose an order payment issue
node scripts/diagnose-order-payment.js <order_id>

# Fix a stuck order (includes charging and DB update)
node scripts/fix-order-payment.js <order_id>

# Just update order status after manual Stripe charge
node scripts/fix-order-payment-simple.js <order_id> <payment_intent_id>
```

## Impact Assessment

### Potential Affected Orders
Any laundry orders where:
1. Partner submitted a quote
2. Order status is `awaiting_payment` or `pending_admin_approval`
3. Order has `saved_payment_method_id` but no `stripe_customer_id`

**Recommended Action:**
Run diagnostic script on all `awaiting_payment` orders to identify and fix similar cases.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Data Consistency:** Critical payment identifiers must be copied to orders when quotes are created
2. **Off-Session Payments:** Backend-initiated charges require `off_session: true` flag
3. **Database Schema:** The `payment_intent_id` column doesn't exist, causing script failures
4. **Validation Gaps:** Better validation needed when partners submit quotes
5. **Testing Coverage:** Need integration tests for quote → payment flow

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Priority 1)
- [x] Fix affected order
- [x] Patch partner quote endpoint
- [x] Update admin approval endpoint
- [x] Update fix scripts

### Short Term (Priority 2)
- [ ] Audit all `awaiting_payment` orders for missing `stripe_customer_id`
- [ ] Add database migration to add `payment_intent_id` column if needed
- [ ] Add validation to reject quote submissions if profile has no `stripe_customer_id`
- [ ] Create alerting for orders stuck in `awaiting_payment` > 24 hours

### Long Term (Priority 3)
- [ ] Add integration tests for partner quote → admin approval → payment flow
- [ ] Consider adding `stripe_customer_id` as required field on order creation
- [ ] Review all endpoints that update orders for similar data consistency issues
- [ ] Add monitoring dashboard for payment success rates

## Files Modified

1. `app/api/partner/orders/[id]/quote/route.ts` - Added stripe_customer_id copying
2. `app/api/admin/quotes/approve/route.ts` - Added off_session flag, removed unsupported fields
3. `scripts/fix-order-payment.js` - Updated with off_session flag
4. `scripts/fix-order-payment-simple.js` - Created new simple fix script
