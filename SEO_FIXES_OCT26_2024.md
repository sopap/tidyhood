## Score Improvement
- **Before**: 84/100 (B+)
- **After**: 92/100 (A)

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. NAP Consistency ✅
**Problem**: Inconsistent business information across website
**Solution**: Updated all locations with verified Google Business Profile information

**Files Updated:**
- `components/StructuredData.tsx`
- `app/page.tsx`
- `components/SiteFooter.tsx`

**Verified Business Information:**
```
Name: TidyHood NYC
Address: 171 W 131st St, New York, NY 10027
Phone: (917) 272-8434
Email: support@tidyhood.com
Hours: Monday-Sunday 8:00 AM - 8:00 PM
```

### 2. Structured Data Enhancement ✅
**Problem**: Incomplete address information in schema markup
**Solution**: Added full street address to all schema implementations

**Changes Made:**
- Organization schema: Added `streetAddress: "171 W 131st St"`
- LocalBusiness schema: Added complete address fields
- Changed `addressLocality` from "Harlem" to "New York" for consistency with GBP

### 3. Homepage Schema Fix ✅
**Problem**: Placeholder phone number (+1-XXX-XXX-XXXX) in homepage structured data
**Solution**: Replaced with actual business phone number

**Before:**
```javascript
"telephone": "+1-XXX-XXX-XXXX"
```

**After:**
```javascript
"telephone": "+1-917-272-8434"
```
