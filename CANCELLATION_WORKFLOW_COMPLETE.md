## üéØ Business Rules Implemented

### **Laundry Service**
```typescript
{
  canCancel: true,
  canReschedule: true,
  requiresNotice: false,
  cancellationFee: 0,
  rescheduleFee: 0,
  refundAmount: order.total_cents, // Full refund
  reason: "Free cancellation and rescheduling"
}
```

### **Cleaning Service**
```typescript
// With 24+ hours notice
{
  canCancel: true,
  canReschedule: true,
  requiresNotice: true,
  cancellationFee: 0,
  rescheduleFee: 0,
  refundAmount: order.total_cents,
  reason: "Free cancellation with 24+ hours notice"
}

// Within 24 hours
{
  canCancel: true,
  canReschedule: true,
  requiresNotice: true,
  cancellationFee: order.total_cents * 0.15, // 15% fee
  rescheduleFee: order.total_cents * 0.15,
  refundAmount: order.total_cents * 0.85,
  reason: "15% cancellation fee applies within 24 hours of service"
}
```

### **Universal Restrictions**
- ‚ùå Cannot cancel/reschedule completed orders
- ‚ùå Cannot modify already cancelled orders
- ‚ùå Cannot reschedule to past dates
- ‚úÖ Status must be in: PENDING_PICKUP, AWAITING_PAYMENT, PICKED_UP

---

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### **Unit Tests Needed**
```bash
# Fee calculation logic
lib/__tests__/cancellationFees.test.ts
- ‚úì Laundry: always free
- ‚úì Cleaning: free with 24+ hours
- ‚úì Cleaning: 15% fee within 24 hours
- ‚úì Edge case: exactly 24 hours
- ‚úì Completed orders return false for can cancel/reschedule

# API routes
app/api/orders/[id]/__tests__/cancel.test.ts
- ‚úì Successful cancellation
- ‚úì Invalid order ID
- ‚úì Unauthorized access
- ‚úì Already cancelled order
- ‚úì Completed order rejection

app/api/orders/[id]/__tests__/reschedule.test.ts
- ‚úì Successful reschedule
- ‚úì Invalid slot selection
- ‚úì Past date rejection
- ‚úì Capacity validation
```

### **Integration Tests**
```typescript
// E2E test scenarios
describe('Cancellation Flow', () => {
  test('Laundry - Free cancellation', async () => {
    // 1. Create laundry order
    // 2. Navigate to order details
    // 3. Click cancel button
    // 4. Select reason
    // 5. Confirm cancellation
    // 6. Verify full refund
    // 7. Verify order status = CANCELLED
  })
  
  test('Cleaning - Free with >24hrs notice', async () => {
    // Similar flow with future cleaning order
  })
  
  test('Cleaning - 15% fee with <24hrs notice', async () => {
    // Create order with slot_start in 12 hours
    // Verify fee is calculated and displayed
    // Verify partial refund
  })
})

describe('Reschedule Flow', () => {
  test('Select new slot and reschedule', async () => {
    // 1. Create order
    // 2. Click reschedule
    // 3. Select new date
    // 4. Select new slot
    // 5. Confirm
    // 6. Verify order updated
  })
  
  test('Fee charged for <24hr reschedule', async () => {
    // Verify fee calculation and charge
  })
})
```

## üö® Edge Cases & Error Handling

### **1. Race Conditions**
**Problem**: User opens modal, partner cancels order in background
**Solution**: API validates order status on every request
```typescript
// In cancel/reschedule API
if (order.status === 'CANCELLED' || order.status === 'COMPLETED') {
  return { error: 'Order cannot be modified' }
}
```

### **2. Slot Availability**
**Problem**: Selected slot becomes unavailable during reschedule flow
**Solution**: API validates slot capacity before updating
```typescript
// In reschedule API
const slot = await getSlot(new_slot_start)
if (slot.available_units === 0) {
  return { error: 'Selected slot is no longer available' }
}
```

### **3. Payment Failures**
**Problem**: Refund processing fails
**Solution**: Order marked as cancelled, refund queued for manual processing
```typescript
try {
  await processRefund(order)
} catch (error) {
  await logFailedRefund(order.id, error)
  // Admin notified, manual intervention required
}
```

### **4. Concurrent Modifications**
**Problem**: Two API calls updating same order simultaneously
**Solution**: Database transaction with optimistic locking
```typescript
// Use updated_at for version control
UPDATE orders 
SET status = 'CANCELLED', updated_at = NOW()
WHERE id = $1 AND updated_at = $2
```

### **5. Browser Issues**
**Problem**: User closes browser during cancellation
**Solution**: Idempotency keys prevent duplicate operations
```typescript
// API checks for existing cancellation with same key
const existing = await getCancellationByIdempotencyKey(key)
if (existing) {
  return existing // Return cached result
}
```

## üì± Mobile Considerations

### **Responsive Breakpoints**
```css
/* Mobile: < 768px */
- Bottom-aligned modals
- Full-width buttons
- Stacked button layouts
- Condensed slot picker

/* Tablet: 768px - 1024px */
- Centered modals with max-width
- Side-by-side buttons where appropriate

/* Desktop: > 1024px */
- Centered modals (max-width 2xl)
- Standard button layouts
```

### **Touch Interactions**
- Minimum touch target: 44px √ó 44px
- No hover-dependent features
- Swipe-friendly modals (close on backdrop tap)
- Proper focus management for keyboard users

---

## üîê Security Considerations

### **Authorization**
```typescript
// Every API call validates ownership
const order = await getOrder(orderId)
if (order.user_id !== session.user.id) {
  return { error: 'Unauthorized', status: 403 }
}
```

### **Input Validation**
```typescript
// Validate all user inputs
- reason: max 500 characters
- slot_start: future date only
- partner_id: exists and has capacity
```

### **Rate Limiting**
```typescript
// Prevent abuse
- Max 5 cancellation attempts per hour
- Max 10 reschedule attempts per hour
```

## üöÄ Deployment Checklist

### **Pre-Deployment**
- [ ] Run all unit tests
- [ ] Run integration tests
- [ ] Manual QA on staging environment
- [ ] Test on actual mobile devices
- [ ] Verify database migration runs cleanly
- [ ] Check API error logging is configured
- [ ] Verify Stripe refund processing works
- [ ] Test email notifications (if implemented)

### **Database Migration**
```bash
# Apply migration 019
supabase db push

# Verify tables created
- cancellation_log
- capacity_adjustments (if needed)

# Verify triggers work
- update_capacity_on_reschedule
```

### **Environment Variables**
```bash
# Ensure these are set
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_...
SUPABASE_URL=https://...
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJh...
```

### **Monitoring Setup**
```typescript
// Track key metrics
- Cancellation rate by service type
- Reschedule rate by service type
- Fee revenue from <24hr changes
- Average refund amount
- API error rates
```

### **Post-Deployment**
- [ ] Monitor error logs for 24 hours
- [ ] Check cancellation success rate
- [ ] Verify refunds are processing
- [ ] Monitor customer support tickets
- [ ] Gather user feedback
- [ ] Track analytics metrics

---

## üìä Success Metrics

### **Primary KPIs**
- **Self-Service Rate**: % of cancellations without support ticket
  - Target: >90%

  - Target: <1%

### **Secondary Metrics**

## üêõ Known Limitations
