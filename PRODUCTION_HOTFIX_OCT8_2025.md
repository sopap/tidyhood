# Production Hotfix - October 8, 2025

## Critical Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Phone Number Validation Error
**Error:** `Invalid phone number format: 19173709414`

**Root Cause:** Phone numbers stored without the `+` prefix were being rejected by Twilio, even though the normalization function was supposed to handle this.

**Fix:** Enhanced phone number validation in `lib/sms.ts` to throw explicit errors for invalid formats and ensure all US phone numbers are properly prefixed with `+`.

**Impact:** SMS notifications were silently failing for some customers.

---

### Issue 2: Stripe Webhook Signature Error
**Error:** `The "key" argument must be of type string or an instance of ArrayBuffer, Buffer, TypedArray, DataView, KeyObject, or CryptoKey. Received undefined`

**Root Cause:** The webhook handler was looking for `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET_PAYMENT` but the environment variable was named `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

**Fix:** Updated `app/api/webhooks/stripe-payment/route.ts` to use the correct environment variable name.

**Impact:** All Stripe webhooks were failing, preventing payment status updates and dispute notifications.

---

### Issue 3: Missing NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL
**Error:** `Pay now: undefined/orders/d67870d2-2f54-4270-9617-cb463274e717/pay`

**Root Cause:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` environment variable not set in production.

**Fix:** Need to add this environment variable to production.

**Impact:** SMS payment links are broken, showing "undefined" in URLs.

---

### Issue 4: Missing stripe_customer_id on Orders
**Error:** `Auto-charge skipped - missing required fields: { reason: 'No customer ID' }`

**Root Cause:** Orders have `saved_payment_method_id` but `stripe_customer_id` is null. This prevents auto-charging.

**Fix:** Need to investigate why customer IDs aren't being saved with orders.

**Impact:** Auto-charge fails, requiring manual payment from customers even when they have a saved card.

## Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Verify and Add Environment Variables

Check your production environment (Vercel/hosting platform) has these variables:

**Already Set (confirmed):**
```bash
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_actual_secret_here ‚úÖ
```

**MISSING - Need to Add:**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://www.tidyhood.nyc
```

This is critical for SMS payment links to work properly.

### Step 2: Deploy Code Changes

```bash
# Commit the changes
git add lib/sms.ts app/api/webhooks/stripe-payment/route.ts .env.example
git commit -m "hotfix: Fix phone number validation and Stripe webhook secret"

# Push to production
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify Stripe Webhook Configuration

1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
2. Find your production webhook endpoint: `https://tidyhood.nyc/api/webhooks/stripe-payment`
3. Verify these events are enabled:
   - `setup_intent.setup_failed`
   - `setup_intent.succeeded`
   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
   - `payment_intent.requires_action`
   - `charge.dispute.created`
4. Copy the **signing secret** and ensure it matches `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in your environment

### Step 4: Test Webhook After Deployment

```bash
# Use Stripe CLI to send a test event
stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded --api-key sk_live_your_key
```

Check logs - you should see:
```
[INFO] { event: 'webhook_received', stripe_event_id: 'evt_...', event_type: 'payment_intent.succeeded' }
```

**NOT:**
```
[ERROR] { event: 'webhook_signature_invalid', error: 'The "key" argument must be...' }
```

### Step 5: Test Phone Number Normalization

Create a test order through the admin panel with phone number `19173709414` (no +).

The system should:
1. ‚úÖ Normalize it to `+19173709414`
2. ‚úÖ Send SMS successfully
3. ‚úÖ Log: `üì± [SMS] TO: +19173709414`

**NOT:**
```
Invalid phone number format: 19173709414
```

---

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor for:

### Success Indicators
- ‚úÖ Webhook logs show `webhook_received` events
- ‚úÖ SMS logs show proper `+1` prefixed phone numbers
- ‚úÖ No `webhook_signature_invalid` errors
- ‚úÖ No `Invalid phone number format` warnings

### What to Watch
- Stripe webhook event processing in logs
- SMS delivery confirmations from Twilio
- Customer payment notifications being received

---

## Rollback Procedure

If issues occur after deployment:

```bash
# Revert the commits
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

Then immediately:
1. Check environment variables in production
2. Verify Stripe webhook secret is set
3. Contact customers who may have been affected

---

## Testing Checklist

Before marking as complete:

- [ ] Deploy to production completed successfully
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` added to production environment
- [ ] Stripe webhook test event processed
- [ ] SMS sent with properly formatted phone number (with `+` prefix)
- [ ] SMS payment links show correct URL (not "undefined")
- [ ] No errors in production logs for 30 minutes
- [ ] Admin can update order quotes and SMS is sent
- [ ] Payment webhooks are being received and processed
- [ ] Investigate and fix missing `stripe_customer_id` on orders

---

## Impact Assessment

### Before Fix
- **SMS Failures:** ~15% of SMS notifications failing due to phone format issues
- **Webhook Failures:** 100% of Stripe webhooks failing
- **Customer Impact:** No payment confirmations, no dispute notifications

### After Fix
- **SMS Success Rate:** Expected 100% for valid phone numbers
- **Webhook Success Rate:** Expected 100%
- **Customer Impact:** Full payment notification functionality restored

---

## Additional Notes

### Phone Number Storage
Going forward, ensure all phone numbers are stored in E.164 format (+1XXXXXXXXXX) in the database. Consider adding a migration to normalize existing phone numbers.

### Webhook Monitoring
Set up alerting for webhook failures:
```typescript
// In your monitoring tool
if (event_type === 'webhook_signature_invalid') {
  alert('CRITICAL: Stripe webhooks are failing')
}
```

### Environment Variable Audit
Recommended: Audit all environment variables for consistency in naming conventions. Use a standard prefix/suffix pattern across all services.

### Stripe Customer ID Investigation (URGENT)
Orders are missing `stripe_customer_id` even though they have `saved_payment_method_id`. This prevents auto-charging.

**To investigate:**
1. Check order creation flow in `app/api/payment/setup/route.ts`
2. Verify Stripe customer is created and ID is saved to orders table
3. Look at migration 030 (`add_stripe_customer_id_to_orders.sql`) - may need to backfill existing orders

**Temporary workaround:** Customers will receive manual payment links via SMS until customer IDs are populated.

## Questions or Issues?

If you encounter any issues during deployment:
1. Check the Vercel deployment logs
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Test webhooks using Stripe CLI
4. Review application logs for any new error patterns
