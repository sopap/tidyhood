# Laundry Payment Flow Deprecation - Implementation Complete

**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Implementation Complete - Ready for Testing

## Overview

Successfully deprecated the old deferred payment Stripe implementation. All new laundry orders now use Setup Intent with admin-approved auto-charge, providing payment guarantee while maintaining backward compatibility for existing legacy orders.

## Implementation Summary

### What Changed

**Customer Experience:**
- Payment method collection is now **REQUIRED** at booking time
- Clear $0.00 messaging - card saved but not charged immediately
- Informative status messages throughout order lifecycle
- Legacy orders still supported with amber warning UI

**Partner Workflow:**
- Partner quotes go to `pending_admin_approval` status
- No direct customer payment interaction
- Clear payment method availability indicators

**Admin Workflow:**
- New endpoint: `/api/admin/orders/[id]/direct-quote` for direct quote + auto-charge
- Existing: `/api/admin/quotes/approve` for partner quote approval
- Visual indicators for payment method status
- Comprehensive logging for monitoring

---

## Changes by Phase

### Phase 1: UI Safety Fixes ✅

**File:** `app/orders/[id]/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Extended Order interface with payment fields (`saved_payment_method_id`, `stripe_customer_id`, `pending_admin_approval`)
- Added helper functions:
  - `shouldShowLegacyPayButton()` - Detects orders requiring manual payment
  - `shouldShowPaymentMethodInfo()` - Detects Setup Intent orders
  - `getPaymentMethodMessage()` - Contextual messaging by status
- UI now shows:
  - **Legacy orders:** Amber warning banner + "Pay Now" button
  - **Setup Intent orders:** Blue info banner explaining auto-charge timing

**Testing:** ✅ Verified - UI renders correctly for both order types

---

### Phase 2: Booking Form Simplification ✅

**File:** `app/book/laundry/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Removed feature flag state and conditional logic
- Removed old deferred payment code path entirely
- Payment method collection now ALWAYS visible
- Simplified `handleSubmit` to only use `/api/payment/setup` endpoint
- Updated form validation to always require `paymentMethodId`

**File:** `lib/feature-flags.ts`

**Changes:**
- Added `@deprecated` notice to `isSetupIntentEnabled()`
- Function now always returns `true`
- Kept for backward compatibility only

**Impact:** All new laundry bookings will have payment methods saved upfront

---

### Phase 3: Backend Deprecation Warnings ✅

**File:** `app/api/orders/route.ts`

**Changes:**
- Added console warnings when laundry orders are created via deprecated endpoint
- Logs user ID and idempotency key for tracking
- Marks deprecated orders with metadata flags:
  - `_deprecated_payment_flow: true`
  - `_created_via_deprecated_endpoint: timestamp`

**File:** `app/api/orders/[id]/pay/route.ts`

**Changes:**
- Added `@deprecated` JSDoc notice
- Clearly documented this is for legacy orders only
- Added detailed logging:
  - `[LEGACY_PAYMENT]` prefix for easy grep
  - Logs order ID, user ID, service type, status
  - Logs payment method presence

**Monitoring:** Watch server logs for `[DEPRECATED]` and `[LEGACY_PAYMENT]` tags

---

### Phase 4: State Machine Cleanup ✅

**File:** `lib/orderStateMachine.ts`

**New Helper Functions:**

```typescript
// Check if order can be auto-charged based on actor role
canAutoCharge(order, actorRole): boolean

// Determine if order uses legacy payment flow
isLegacyPaymentFlow(order): boolean

// Get appropriate status after quote submission
getPostQuoteStatus(order, actorRole): OrderStatus
```

**New Transitions:**
- Admin direct quote: `at_facility` → `paid_processing` (with auto-charge)
- Legacy orders: `at_facility` → `awaiting_payment` (manual payment required)
- Setup Intent with approval: Uses existing `pending_admin_approval` flow

**Authorization Logic:**
- **Admin role:** Can auto-charge immediately (trusted)
- **Partner role:** Must go through admin approval
- **User role:** Cannot auto-charge themselves

---

### Phase 5: Admin Direct Quote Auto-Charge ✅

**New File:** `app/api/admin/orders/[id]/direct-quote/route.ts`

**Functionality:**
- Admin-only endpoint (role verification)
- Calculates quote based on actual weight
- Validates payment method availability
- Auto-charges customer's saved payment method
- Creates payment intent with Stripe
- Updates order to `paid_processing` status
- Logs quote creation and auto-charge events
- Sends SMS receipt to customer
- Handles Stripe errors gracefully

**Security:**
- Requires admin role
- Uses off-session payment confirmation
- Logs all actions for audit trail
- Error handling with retry logging

### New Orders (Setup Intent Flow)

```
User books → Payment method saved via Setup Intent
    ↓
Order created: status = pending_pickup
    ↓
Partner picks up → status = at_facility
    ↓
Partner/Admin weighs → creates quote

## API Endpoints

### Active Endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose | Flow | Notes |
|----------|---------|------|-------|
| `/api/payment/setup` | Create order with Setup Intent | NEW | All new bookings use this |
| `/api/admin/orders/[id]/direct-quote` | Admin quote + auto-charge | NEW | Bypasses approval |
| `/api/admin/quotes/approve` | Approve partner quote + charge | EXISTING | For partner quotes |
| `/api/orders/[id]/pay` | Manual payment | LEGACY | For old orders only |
| `/api/orders` | Create order (old flow) | DEPRECATED | Logs warnings |

### Deprecated Endpoints

- `/api/orders` POST for laundry - Still works but logs deprecation warnings
- Should see decreased usage over time as old code paths are avoided

## Monitoring & Metrics

### Key Metrics to Track

**Success Indicators:**
- ✅ Zero new orders created without `saved_payment_method_id`
- ✅ Decreased usage of `/api/orders/[id]/pay` endpoint
- ✅ Increased `pending_admin_approval` status orders
- ✅ No increase in customer support inquiries
- ✅ Stable or improved payment success rate

**Warning Signs:**
- ⚠️ Increase in `[DEPRECATED]` log messages (means old code still being triggered)
- ⚠️ Orders created with `_deprecated_payment_flow: true`
- ⚠️ Payment authorization failures
- ⚠️ Customer complaints about payment confusion

### Log Monitoring

**Search for these patterns in server logs:**

```bash
# Deprecated endpoint usage
grep "\[DEPRECATED\]" logs/

# Legacy payment flow usage
grep "\[LEGACY_PAYMENT\]" logs/

# Admin quote auto-charges
grep "\[ADMIN_QUOTE\]" logs/

# Payment failures
grep "Stripe charge failed" logs/
```

### Database Queries for Monitoring

```sql
-- Count orders by payment flow type
SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN saved_payment_method_id IS NOT NULL THEN 'Setup Intent'
    ELSE 'Legacy/Manual'
  END as payment_flow,
  COUNT(*) as order_count
FROM orders
WHERE service_type = 'LAUNDRY'
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY payment_flow;

-- Find orders using deprecated endpoint
SELECT id, created_at, status, user_id
FROM orders
WHERE service_type = 'LAUNDRY'
  AND order_details->>'_deprecated_payment_flow' = 'true'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 50;

-- Check pending admin approvals
SELECT id, created_at, quote_cents, pending_admin_approval
FROM orders  
WHERE status = 'pending_admin_approval'
  AND service_type = 'LAUNDRY'
ORDER BY created_at ASC;
```

---

## Rollback Procedures

### If Issues Arise

**Option A: Rollback Individual Phases** (Recommended)

Revert commits in reverse order:

1. Phase 6: Documentation (safe to skip)
2. Phase 5: Admin direct quote endpoint (delete file if unused)
3. Phase 4: State machine helpers (revert file)
4. Phase 3: Backend warnings (remove logging, restore old behavior)
5. Phase 2: Booking form (restore feature flag conditional)
6. Phase 1: UI fixes (restore old showPayButton logic)

**Option B: Emergency Full Rollback**

```bash
# Find the commit before this implementation started
git log --oneline --grep="LAUNDRY_PAYMENT_DEPRECATION"

# Reset to commit before changes
git reset --hard <commit-hash-before-changes>

# Force push if already deployed (DANGEROUS - coordinate with team)
git push --force
```

**Option C: Feature Flag Toggle** (If needed)

Update `.env.production`:
```bash
# Temporarily disable Setup Intent requirement
NEXT_PUBLIC_SETUP_INTENT_ENABLED=false
```

This won't help much since we removed the conditional, but keeping for reference.

## Migration Path for Existing Orders

### DO NOT Migrate Legacy Orders

**Critical:** Do not attempt to backfill `saved_payment_method_id` for existing orders. This could cause:
- Payment authorization issues
- Unexpected charges
- Customer confusion
- Legal compliance concerns

### Handle Legacy Orders

**Strategy:**
1. Let legacy orders complete their lifecycle naturally
2. Support `/api/orders/[id]/pay` endpoint indefinitely
3. Monitor usage - should trend toward zero over time
4. Consider archiving after 90 days of no usage

---

## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] All phases implemented and tested locally
- [ ] Database schema supports new fields (`saved_payment_method_id`, etc.)
- [ ] Stripe keys configured correctly
- [ ] SMS service functional
- [ ] Error monitoring in place (Sentry/DataDog)

### Deployment Steps
- [ ] Deploy during low-traffic hours (recommended: 2-4 AM EST)
- [ ] Monitor error rates for first 30 minutes
- [ ] Test new booking flow in production
- [ ] Verify legacy orders still functional
- [ ] Check server logs for deprecation warnings

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Monitor for 24 hours
- [ ] Check payment success rates
- [ ] Review customer support tickets
- [ ] Verify no increase in errors
- [ ] Confirm SMS receipts being sent

---

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Customer says "Pay Now" button isn't working
- **Cause:** Legacy order without payment method
- **Solution:** Guide them through manual payment flow
- **Prevention:** Shouldn't happen for new orders

**Issue:** Partner quote not auto-charging
- **Cause:** Partner quotes need admin approval (by design)
- **Solution:** Admin must approve via dashboard
- **Note:** This is intended behavior

**Issue:** Admin direct quote fails to charge
- **Causes:**
  1. Missing `saved_payment_method_id` (legacy order)
  2. Stripe API error
  3. Insufficient funds / declined card
- **Solutions:**
  1. Use legacy manual payment flow
  2. Check Stripe dashboard for details
  3. Contact customer for alternate payment

**Issue:** Order stuck in `pending_admin_approval`
- **Cause:** Partner quote awaiting admin action
- **Solution:** Admin needs to approve via `/api/admin/quotes/approve`
- **Timeline:** Should be resolved within 24 hours

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check order payment status
node scripts/check-order-payment-status.js <order-id>

# View recent deprecation warnings
tail -f logs/production.log | grep "\[DEPRECATED\]"

# Count legacy vs Setup Intent orders today
# (Run SQL query from monitoring section)
```

---

## Future Cleanup (Post-Deprecation)

### After 90 Days of Zero Legacy Usage

Consider removing:
1. `/api/orders` POST endpoint for laundry (or make it error)
2. `/api/orders/[id]/pay` endpoint (archive only)
3. `isSetupIntentEnabled()` function (fully deprecated)
4. `PaymentModal` component (if unused elsewhere)
5. Conditional UI logic for legacy orders
6. `_deprecated_payment_flow` metadata flags

### Database Cleanup

After legacy orders are archived:
- Consider adding `NOT NULL` constraint to `saved_payment_method_id` for new rows
- Archive old payment flow documentation
- Update API documentation to remove legacy endpoints

---

## Success Criteria

### Metrics (30 Days Post-Deployment)

**Target Achievements:**
- ✅ 100% of new orders have `saved_payment_method_id`
- ✅ Zero new orders with `_deprecated_payment_flow: true`
- ✅ <5% of payments using legacy endpoint
- ✅ Payment success rate ≥95%
- ✅ Zero critical payment-related bugs
- ✅ Customer satisfaction maintained or improved

**Acceptable Deviations:**
- Legacy orders may still complete (expected)
- Partner approval workflow may take time to optimize
- Some edge cases may need refinement

---

## Key Files Modified

### Frontend
- `app/orders/[id]/page.tsx` - Order detail with legacy/Setup Intent detection
- `app/book/laundry/page.tsx` - Booking form (Setup Intent only)
- `lib/feature-flags.ts` - Deprecated flag, always returns true

### Backend
- `app/api/orders/route.ts` - Added deprecation warnings
