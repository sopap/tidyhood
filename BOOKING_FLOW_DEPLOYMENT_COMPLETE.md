**Fix Required:** Access Supabase dashboard, fix RLS policies  
**Priority:** Fix within 1 week

**How to Fix:**
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor:
SELECT * FROM cancellation_policies WHERE active = true;

-- If no results, insert default policies:
INSERT INTO cancellation_policies (
  service_type, version, active,
  notice_hours, cancellation_fee_percent,
  reschedule_notice_hours, reschedule_fee_percent,
  allow_cancellation, allow_rescheduling
) VALUES 
('LAUNDRY', 1, true, 0, 0, 0, 0, true, true),
('CLEANING', 1, true, 24, 0.5, 24, 0.25, true, true);

-- Verify RLS policies allow service role:
CREATE POLICY "Allow service role full access" ON cancellation_policies
  FOR ALL
  TO service_role
  USING (true)
  WITH CHECK (true);
```
