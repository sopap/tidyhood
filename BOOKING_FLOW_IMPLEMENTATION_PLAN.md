# Booking Flow Implementation Plan
**Created:** October 25, 2025  
**Status:** Ready for Execution  
**Priority:** HIGH - Estimated +30-45% conversion increase

---

## Executive Summary

### Current Situation
- **Live booking flow score:** 5.8/10 (underperforming)
- **Improved version:** Built but NOT deployed (file: `app/book/laundry/page-fixed.tsx`)
- **Critical bugs:** API 401 error, Google Maps deprecation warning
- **Estimated impact:** +30-45% conversion increase when deployed

### Key Finding
Most improvements are **already built** and just need safe deployment. The current production page is functional but missing critical UX features that competitors have.

### Implementation Strategy
**3-Phase Approach:** Bug fixes ‚Üí Staged deployment ‚Üí Monitoring & optimization

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks for complete, safe rollout

---

## Critical Issues Discovered

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: File Naming Discrepancy
- **Documentation states:** Improved version at `app/book/laundry/page-new.tsx`
- **Reality:** File is actually named `app/book/laundry/page-fixed.tsx`
- **Action Required:** Update all documentation references OR rename file before deployment

### üî¥ Bug #1: Cancellation Policy API 401 Error
**File:** `app/api/policies/cancellation/route.ts`  
**Status:** NEEDS INVESTIGATION  
**Impact:** Users cannot see cancellation terms before booking (legal/compliance risk)  
**Priority:** P0 - Must fix before deployment  
**Estimated Fix Time:** 30-60 minutes

**Investigation Steps:**
1. Read the endpoint file and check authentication requirements
2. Verify if endpoint should be public vs authenticated
3. Fix authentication logic or make endpoint publicly accessible
4. Test that policy data returns correctly
5. Deploy fix immediately (independent of booking page deployment)

### üü° Bug #2: Google Maps Deprecation Warning
**Files:** `lib/googleMaps.ts` or `components/AddressAutocomplete.tsx`  
**Status:** NEEDS MIGRATION  
**Impact:** Address autocomplete will break March 2025  
**Priority:** P1 - High urgency  
**Deadline:** Before March 2025  
**Estimated Fix Time:** 2-4 hours  
**Reference:** `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_FIX.md`

**Migration Required:**
- Migrate from deprecated API to PlaceAutocompleteElement API
- Test thoroughly in all browsers
- Verify address validation still works
- Deploy before critical deadline

---

## Phase 1: Pre-Deployment (Week 1)

### Day 1-2: Critical Bug Fixes

**Priority 1: Fix Cancellation Policy 401 Error**
```bash
# Steps:
1. Investigate app/api/policies/cancellation/route.ts
2. Determine if auth requirement is intentional
3. Fix or make public
4. Test endpoint returns data
5. Deploy fix (independent deployment)
6. Verify on production
```

**Priority 2: Google Maps Deprecation**
```bash
# Steps:
1. Review current implementation in lib/googleMaps.ts
2. Follow GOOGLE_MAPS_API_FIX.md migration guide
3. Update to PlaceAutocompleteElement API
4. Test address autocomplete functionality
5. Deploy fix (independent deployment)
6. Verify on production
```

### Day 3-4: File Verification & Documentation

**Verify All Improvement Files Exist:**
- [x] `app/book/laundry/page-fixed.tsx` (renamed from page-new.tsx?)
- [ ] `lib/estimate.ts` (pricing with promo codes)
- [ ] `lib/slots.ts` (client-side slot utilities)
- [ ] `lib/a11y.ts` (accessibility helpers)
- [ ] `lib/debounce.ts` (API call debouncing)
- [ ] `components/ui/Tooltip.tsx` (accessible tooltips)
- [ ] `components/booking/Stepper.tsx` (progress indicator)
- [ ] `components/booking/EstimatePanel.tsx` (real-time price)
- [ ] `components/booking/StickyCTA.tsx` (mobile CTA bar)
- [ ] `components/booking/Addons.tsx` (enhanced addons)
- [ ] `app/api/estimate/route.ts` (NEW endpoint)
- [ ] `__tests__/booking.spec.tsx` (test suite)

**Action Items:**
1. List all files with `list_files` command
2. Read key files to verify completeness
3. Check for TODO comments or incomplete implementations
4. Run TypeScript compiler to check for errors
5. Run existing test suite

### Day 5: Environment & Dependency Audit

**Environment Variables Check:**
```bash
# Required variables:
‚úì NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
‚úì DATABASE_URL
‚úì NEXT_PUBLIC_ALLOWED_ZIPS
‚úì GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY

# Optional but recommended:
‚úì SENTRY_DSN
‚úì VERCEL_ENV
```

**Dependency Audit:**
```bash
npm audit              # Check for vulnerabilities
npm test               # Run all tests
npx tsc --noEmit       # TypeScript compilation check
```

**Database Schema Verification:**
- Verify `orders` table supports new fields
- Check `capacity_calendar` compatibility
- Ensure Supabase RLS policies allow new operations

---

## Phase 2: Staged Deployment (Week 2)

### Option A: Feature Flag Deployment (RECOMMENDED - Safest)

**Advantages:**
- Instant rollback (change env var)
- Gradual traffic rollout (10% ‚Üí 50% ‚Üí 100%)
- A/B testing capability
- Zero downtime

**Implementation:**

**Step 1: Add Feature Flag Logic**
```typescript
// lib/feature-flags.ts (already exists)
export const features = {
  ...existing flags,
  useImprovedBookingFlow: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_NEW_BOOKING_ENABLED === 'true'
};
```

**Step 2: Update Booking Page**
```typescript
// app/book/laundry/page.tsx
import { features } from '@/lib/feature-flags';

export default function LaundryBookingPage() {
  if (features.useImprovedBookingFlow) {
    // Import and use components from page-fixed.tsx
    return <ImprovedBookingFlow />;
  }
  // Keep current implementation as fallback
  return <LegacyBookingFlow />;
}
```

**Step 3: Rollout Schedule**
```bash
# Day 1: Deploy code (flag OFF by default)
git add .
git commit -m "Add improved booking flow (behind feature flag)"
git push origin main

# Day 2: Enable for 10% of users (set env var in Vercel)
NEXT_PUBLIC_NEW_BOOKING_ENABLED=true  # + routing logic for 10%

# Day 3-4: Monitor metrics, fix issues if any

# Day 5: Increase to 50%
# Update routing logic

# Day 6-7: Monitor metrics

# Day 8: Increase to 100%
# All users see new flow

# Day 9-14: Monitor, collect feedback

# Week 3: Remove feature flag code, deploy improved version as default
```

### Option B: Direct Replacement (Faster but riskier)

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Step 1: Backup current version
mv app/book/laundry/page.tsx app/book/laundry/page-legacy-backup.txt
git tag booking-v1-backup
git push origin booking-v1-backup

# Step 2: Rename improved version
mv app/book/laundry/page-fixed.tsx app/book/laundry/page.tsx

# Step 3: Deploy
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy improved booking flow"
git push origin main

# Step 4: Monitor closely for first 24 hours
```

**Rollback Options (if needed):**
1. Vercel dashboard: Promote previous deployment (~30 seconds)
2. Git revert: `git revert HEAD && git push` (~2-3 minutes)
3. Restore backup: `mv page-legacy-backup.txt page.tsx` (~2-3 minutes)

### Testing Protocol for Staging

## Questions to Resolve

Before proceeding with implementation:

1. **File Naming:**
   - Should `page-fixed.tsx` be renamed to `page-new.tsx` for consistency?
   - Or update all documentation to reference `page-fixed.tsx`?

2. **Deployment Preference:**
   - Feature flag approach (safer, slower)?
   - Direct replacement (faster, riskier)?

3. **Testing Resources:**
   - Do you have staging environment access?
   - What testing tools are available?

4. **Monitoring:**
   - Is Sentry or similar error tracking configured?
   - What analytics platform is in use?

5. **Team Coordination:**
   - Who needs to approve production deployments?
   - What's the change management process?
