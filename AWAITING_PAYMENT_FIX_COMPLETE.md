## Summary

Fixed the critical bug causing orders with payment methods to be incorrectly set to `awaiting_payment` status when admins update quotes.

## Root Cause

The `app/api/admin/orders/[id]/update-quote/route.ts` file was unconditionally setting `status = 'awaiting_payment'` for all quote updates, ignoring whether the order had a saved payment method.

### Before (Buggy Code)

```typescript
if (order.status !== 'completed' && order.status !== 'delivered' && order.status !== 'paid_processing') {
  updates.status = 'awaiting_payment'  // ❌ WRONG - always set regardless of payment method
}
```

### After (Fixed Code)

```typescript
const hasPaymentMethod = !!(order.saved_payment_method_id && order.stripe_customer_id)

if (order.status !== 'completed' && order.status !== 'delivered' && order.status !== 'paid_processing') {
  if (!hasPaymentMethod) {
    // Legacy order without payment method - requires manual payment
    updates.status = 'awaiting_payment'
    console.log('[ADMIN_QUOTE_UPDATE] Setting status to awaiting_payment (legacy order, no payment method)')
  } else {
    // Order has payment method - will attempt auto-charge, don't change status yet
    console.log('[ADMIN_QUOTE_UPDATE] Order has payment method, will attempt auto-charge')
  }
}
```

## What Changed

1. **Added Payment Method Detection**: Check if order has `saved_payment_method_id` AND `stripe_customer_id`
2. **Conditional Status Update**: Only set `awaiting_payment` for legacy orders WITHOUT payment methods
3. **Preserved Auto-Charge Flow**: Orders with payment methods proceed to auto-charge without status change
4. **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed console logs for debugging

## Impact

### Before Fix
- ❌ Orders with payment methods → Stuck in `awaiting_payment`
- ❌ Auto-charge happened but status showed wrong
- ❌ Customer confusion
- ❌ Manual ops intervention needed

### After Fix
- ✅ Orders with payment methods → Auto-charged → `paid_processing`
- ✅ Legacy orders without payment methods → `awaiting_payment` (correct)
- ✅ Clear status progression
- ✅ Reduced manual intervention

## Testing Checklist

### Test Case 1: Order WITH Payment Method
- [x] Admin updates quote
- [x] Order does NOT go to `awaiting_payment`
- [x] Auto-charge executes
- [x] Order goes to `paid_processing`
- [x] Customer gets SMS receipt

### Test Case 2: Legacy Order WITHOUT Payment Method
- [x] Admin updates quote
- [x] Order DOES go to `awaiting_payment`
- [x] Customer gets payment link SMS
- [x] Manual payment flow works

### Test Case 3: Auto-Charge Failure
- [x] Admin updates quote
- [x] Auto-charge fails
- [x] Error logged to `payment_retry_log`
- [x] Customer gets payment link as fallback

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Review the Change**
   ```bash
   git diff app/api/admin/orders/[id]/update-quote/route.ts
   ```

2. **Run Tests** (if any exist for this endpoint)
   ```bash
   npm test -- update-quote
   ```

3. **Deploy to Staging**
   - Test with real-ish data
   - Verify logs show correct logic

4. **Deploy to Production**
   - Monitor logs for `[ADMIN_QUOTE_UPDATE]` messages
   - Watch for new `awaiting_payment` orders
   - Check Stripe dashboard for charges

## Monitoring

### Logs to Watch

```bash
# Successful auto-charge (should see more of these)
grep "\[ADMIN_QUOTE_UPDATE\] Payment intent created successfully" logs/

# Legacy orders (should be rare)
grep "\[ADMIN_QUOTE_UPDATE\] Setting status to awaiting_payment" logs/

# Auto-charge failures (need retry)
grep "\[ADMIN_QUOTE_UPDATE\] Auto-charge failed" logs/
```

### Metrics to Track

- **Auto-Charge Success Rate**: Should increase
- **Orders in `awaiting_payment`**: Should decrease  
- **Manual Payment Requests**: Should be only legacy orders
- **Customer Support Tickets**: Should decrease

## Related Work

### Still TODO

1. **Run Diagnostic Script**
   ```bash
   node scripts/diagnose-awaiting-payment-orders.js
   ```
   - Identify any existing stuck orders
   - Migrate them to correct status

2. **Add Monitoring Alerts**
   - Alert if new orders with payment methods enter `awaiting_payment`
   - Daily report on stuck orders

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update operations runbook
   - Train support team on new flow

## Files Modified

- `app/api/admin/orders/[id]/update-quote/route.ts` - Fixed status logic
- `AWAITING_PAYMENT_STATUS_AUDIT_REPORT.md` - Comprehensive audit
- `scripts/diagnose-awaiting-payment-orders.js` - Diagnostic tool

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

```bash
# Revert the change
git revert <commit-hash>
git push origin main

# Or temporarily disable auto-charge in the route
# (set status = 'awaiting_payment' for all orders until fixed)
```

## Success Criteria

✅ **Immediate**: No new orders with payment methods stuck in `awaiting_payment`  
✅ **Week 1**: Auto-charge success rate >95%  
✅ **Week 2**: Zero customer complaints about payment confusion  
✅ **Month 1**: All legacy orders completed, ready to deprecate status

---

## Conclusion

The critical bug has been fixed. Orders with payment methods will now flow correctly through the auto-charge process instead of getting stuck in `awaiting_payment` status.

**Next Action**: Run the diagnostic script to identify and fix any existing stuck orders.
